right hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure 
right total hip replacement


History of Present Illness 
Thank you very much for your request for consultation and
treatment of Mr   Known firstname    Known lastname   for advanced osteoarthritis of
the left hip   He has been seeing Dr   First Name   NamePattern     Last Name  NamePattern    in the  Hospital   
musculoskeletal division and  Doctor Last Name   has referred the patient to me
as well   It is his impression that at this point the patient
has
not had an adequate response either to medications or to an
intraarticular cortisone injection earlier this year and that
total hip replacement is his best course of action   The patient
rates his pain at rest as   with activity    All
interpretations are done via the Portuguese translator   The
patient says that the pain has been progressive over the past
year  most intense with walking on uneven ground  ascending or
descending stairs or getting out of a seated position   He had
very little relief with the cortisone injection even though was
well placed

Pt was admitted to the hospital following the above mentioned
procedure   please see op report for details   Postoperatively 
pt had low urine output and bleeding  and pt was admitted to the
ICU for serial Hcts and monitoring   On POD  pt was transfused
 U PRBCs  and on POD  he received another  U PRBCs for
persistent bleeding  he was hemodynamically stable during this
period   While he was in the ICU  he worked some with PT  but
was limited secondary to pain   Pt s Hct was stable throughout
the remainder of POD   following the transfusion  and on POD 
after   stable serial Hcts  he was transferred to the floor  and
lovenox was started on   in the AM

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS   The patient is a  year old
man with end stage renal disease  diabetes mellitus  and
hypertension  who lives at home   On the day prior to
admission  he underwent routine hemodialysis without
complication   On the morning of admission  he complained of
feeling slightly fatigued and at   p m  he laid down on
his bed   At   p m  on the evening of admission  the
patient reportedly experienced rigors at home and became
febrile   At the same time  he also reportedly became
confused  this is unusual for the patient  who was normally
quite lucid   The patient s wife called   and EMS came
and brought him to an outside hospital 

At that outside hospital  the patient was given
acetaminophen  and then was transferred to the  Hospital     In the
Emergency Department  the patient was noted to be febrile to
  with a heart rate of   blood pressure  
respiratory rate   and oxygen saturation was   on room
air   After blood cultures were drawn  the patient received  
gram of ceftriaxone empirically   A chest x ray was checked
that was consistent with congestive heart failure   The
patient also received a total of   cc of IV fluids in the
Emergency Department after his blood pressure subsequently
dropped   He was then transferred to the MICU

reportedly has a   pack year smoking history   His primary
care physician is  Last Name  NamePattern     Last Name  STitle    whose telephone number is
 Telephone Fax    

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION   Vital signs   The
patient s temperature was   heart rate   blood
pressure   respiratory rate   and oxygen saturation
  on room air   He was somnolent and in no acute distress 
His head was normocephalic  atraumatic   PERRL  and EOMI 
Heart   There was a systolic ejection murmur  rating II VI at
the right upper sternal border and III VI mitral
regurgitation murmur was heard at the apex   Pulmonary 
There was decreased air movement throughout his lung fields
on pulmonary auscultation  there were no crackles or rhonchi 
Abdomen   Soft  nontender  nondistended  and there were
decreased bowel sounds   Rectal   No stool in the rectal
vault   He had no clubbing  cyanosis or edema of his
extremities   Neurologic   Difficult to assess due to the
patient s somnolence 

LABORATORY RADIOLOGIC DATA   The patient s white blood cell
count was    with a differential of   neutrophils   
lymphocytes and   monocytes  hematocrit   and platelet
count of    His PT was   PTT   and INR  
Serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium of   potassium
  chloride   bicarbonate   BUN   creatinine  
glucose   calcium   magnesium   and phosphate  
His ALT was   AST   amylase   alkaline phosphatase  
total bilirubin   and albumin    Initial CK was   and
troponin  

His initial EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at   beats
per minute  normal axis  normal intervals  ST segment
elevations in leads V  and V  and T wave inversions in leads
V  through V   This EKG was reportedly similar to an EKG
that was obtained on  

Initial chest x ray demonstrated a right sided pleural
effusion with cephalization of the vasculature consistent
with congestive heart failure   An initial ABG demonstrated a
pH of   PC  of   and P  of   on   liters of oxygen
by nasal cannula 

Initial head CT was negative for an acute process 

Initial lumbar puncture demonstrated   white blood cells
in tube one and   red blood cells in the same tube   In
tube two  there were   white blood cells    red blood
cells  glucose   and protein  

HOSPITAL COURSE   The patient s initial lumbar puncture was
clear consistent with an infectious bacterial meningitis 
The blood cultures that were obtained in the Emergency
Department ultimately grew out alpha hemolytic Streptococcus 

On hospital day number six  the patient obtained a TEE that
demonstrated a small  mobile  and filamentous vegetation on
the atrial surface of the anterior mitral valve leaflet 
Given this finding  in the context of the patient s
bacteremia and meningitis  it was felt that the patient s
primary source of infection was his bacteremia and
endocarditis  and that he subsequently seated his meninges 
It was felt that the patient s hypotension on admission was
due to this overwhelming infectious process 

As noted above  the patient was admitted to the MICU   He was
continued on ceftriaxone  and vancomycin and ampicillin were
added for empiric antibiotic coverage initially   Once his
bacteremia was speciated as alpha hemolytic streptococcus 
the ampicillin was discontinued 

Throughout the patient s hospitalization  the patient was
managed in conjunction with the Infectious Disease Service as
well as the Renal Service for management of his hemodialysis 

Despite appropriate antibiotic coverage  and despite a brief
period of improvement in the patient s mental status  his
mental status remained poor throughout his hospitalization 

On hospital day number four  a head CT scan was obtained to
evaluate for possible etiology of his altered mental status 
The study was limited by motion artifact but demonstrated no
evidence of hemorrhage or mass affect  normal cisterns were
seen   The paranasal sinuses were unremarkable   No enhancing
lesions were seen   Overall  this was felt to be a negative
head CT scan 

Also  on hospital day number four  the patient had a repeat
chest x ray that demonstrated no new infectious process   He
had a lumbar puncture done on that day  the results were
consistent with resolving bacterial meningitis 

By hospital day number five  the patient s Levophed  which
had been started on hospital day number one due to his
pervasive hypotension  was discontinued  as the patient
remained normotensive without any blood pressure support   A
transthoracic echocardiogram was also done on hospital day
number five   This study did not demonstrate any evidence of
a vegetation but  as noted above  the patient had a TEE done
the next day that did demonstrate a mitral valve vegetation 

Also  on hospital day number six  the patient s bacteremia
was identified as alpha hemolytic streptococcus  and at this
time  his vancomycin was discontinued 

On hospital day number six  an MRI of the head was obtained
to evaluate for possible etiology of the patient s
persistently altered mental status   This study was also
limited due to motion artifact but demonstrated no definitive
evidence of an intracranial mass  mycotic aneurysm  or
abnormal enhancement 

On hospital day number seven  a repeat chest x ray was
obtained   This study raised the question of a possible new
right middle or lower lobe pneumonia  so the patient was
started on metronidazole for a coverage of a possible
aspiration pneumonitis 

On hospital day number eight  the patient had his third
lumbar puncture  this time to rule out the possibility of
communicating hydrocephalus   His opening pressure of  
made this possibility unlikely 

By hospital day number ten  the patient s vital signs had
been stable for several days  although his white blood cell
count remained persistently elevated   In addition  his
mental status remained poor   The patient was intermittently
agitated   He was also persistently somnolent and difficult
to arouse   In order to evaluate for possible etiologies of
his ongoing altered mental status  an abdominal CT scan was
obtained on hospital day number ten   This study demonstrated
bilateral pleural effusions on the right greater than on the
left associated with compressive atelectasis   Also seen were
a few small areas of hypodensity peripherally within the
spleen  likely related to early mixing  although septic
emboli could not be excluded as delayed images were not
obtained   In addition  multiple sigmoid diverticula with
apparent evidence of diverticulitis were seen   Given the
patient s history  these diverticuli were thought to be
possibly related to ischemia 

Finally  smooth  colonic  intraluminal wall thickening of the
cecum was seen   In addition  an MRI scan of the head and
spine was obtained on hospital day number ten given the
patient s ongoing altered mental status   This study
demonstrated small  bilateral  subdural effusions which could
be related to the patient s history of meningitis   Also seen
were mildly prominent ventricles   Cervical spinal MRI was
limited due to motion artifact but demonstrated multiple
levels of degenerative changes without spinal stenosis 
external cord compression  or extrinsic scarring 

In the context of these new findings  as well as given his
persistently elevated white blood cell count and altered
mental status  the patient s antibiotics were broadened to
piperacillin tazobactam on hospital day number  

Overall  despite exhaustive imaging studies  as noted above 
as well as extensive laboratory evaluations  no clear
etiology of the patient s persistently altered mental status
was obtained at any point 

On hospital day number   the patient s blood pressure began
to drop   His systolic blood pressure ranged from  
throughout the afternoon  but remained at a level of   after
a total of   milliliters of intravenous fluid via bolusing 
When the patient s systolic blood pressure remained low
following these intravenous fluid boluses  the available
treatment options were reviewed at length with the patient s
family   The possibility of pursuing full resuscitative
efforts  including CPR with pressors versus maintaining the
patient s DNR DNI status with pressors  versus continuing the
current level of care with intravenous antibiotics 
intravenous medications  tube feeds  and intravenous fluids
as needed for blood pressure support were all reviewed with
the family 

After a lengthy consideration  the family elected to
withdrawal all medical care except for any measures that
might ensure the patient s comfort   The family indicated
that they felt that they were acting in accordance with the
patient s wishes   As a result  on hospital day number  
all medications were withdrawn  as noted above   The only
medications that were continued were to ensure the patient s
comfort   He then died on hospital day number    Time of
death was

Brief Hospital Course 
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery service for
concern of RLE non healing wound ulcer  X rays were concerning
for osteomyelitis  On HD  he was taken to the OR for RLE
Guillotine amputation  Post op course was complicated by
hypotension  pressor  neo  dependence and troponin leak 
cardiology was not convinced that he had an ischemic event  He
was taken to the CVICU and monitored there with daily weaning
trials  On HD  he was transferred from the CVICU to the VICU 
On HD   he underwent a completion BKA and tolerated the
procedure well  He received   sessions of HD  with up to  L of
fluid removed on his last session  For his atrial fibrillation 
he was rate controlled on metoprolol  Per cardiology  Imdur and
Labetalol were stopped  and a new regimen of metoprolol and
lisinopril were started 

Neuro  The patient s pain was well controlled on his home
regimen  He was AAOX  appropriate at all times 
Cardio  On HD  his preop ECG showed atrial flutter  He was seen
by the cardiologist who recommended rate control and a post op
Echo  He also received cardiology clearance for the OR  He was
taken to the OR on HD  and underwent a RLE Guillotine ampuation 
He tolerated the procedure well but became hypotensive in the
PACU necessitating neo drip  He also had a troponin leak and
stablized upon cycling  Cardiology was c s and they were not
impressed by the leak in the setting of ESRD  He also remained
in rate controlled Atrial fibrillation   He was transferred to
the CVICU and was on pressors for a few days afterwards  An Echo
done showed EF   and global hypokinesis  His was weaned off
the drip and transferred to the VICU  On HD  he was taken to
the OR for completion BKA  He tolerated the procedure well  and
was HD stable  He received   doses of coumadin     but
these were stopped and the decision was made to anticoagulate
him one week after discharge 
Pulm  No acute issues  Mild atelectasis b l but maintained good
O  sats during stay
GI  Tolerated diabetic diet  Ensure tid  nephrocaps and good
bowel regimen
Heme  Hcts were monitored and stable
Renal  Histroy of ESRD HD dependent and anuria  Received HD
 T Th Sat        and  
ID  Pan culture was negative  He was treated empiricially with
Vanc HD protocol  cipro  flagyl  These will be continued till
 
Endocrine  SSI was started in house  although he maintained good
glycemic control during his stay so the decision was made to
stop it 
Wounds  His RLE stump was wrapped with kerlex and ACE wrap  His
was placed in a knee immobilizer which was removed on the day of
discharge  He acquired Stage   decibutus ulcer and shearing

T  P   BP   RR   O    on room air  She was given
solumedrol  mg IV  levofloxacin  mg  lasix  mg  and  cc
of saline  CXR was concerning for a bilateral pna  and she was
subsequently transferred to  Hospital    for further management as she
receives her hepatology care here 

On presentation to the ED at  Hospital    her VS were

doxycycline  and gentamicin  mg 

On the medical floor  she was continued on aztreonam 
vancomycin  and azithromycin  The morning of transfer  she was
found to be increasingly tachypneic with an increased O 
requirement  Her sats were   on  L  at which time she was
placed on a non rebreather  She is transferred to the MICU for
closer monitoring given concern for respiratory decompensation

STUDIES 
  PA AND LATERAL CXR  IMPRESSION  Multiple new patchy
airspace opacities bilaterally  most
prominent in the left lower lung  consistent with multifocal
pneumonia 
Follow  up is recommended to ensure clearance

  TTE 
The left atrium is mildly dilated  No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by  D  color Doppler or saline
contrast however images were suboptimal and patient was unable
to cooperate with maneuvers  No evidence of pulmonary AV
shunting identified by technically limited agitated saline
study  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal  The left
ventricular cavity size is normal  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal  LVEF  Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal  The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened  There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis  No aortic regurgitation is seen  The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened  Mild   mitral regurgitation is
seen  The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened  There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension  There is a
trivial physiologic pericardial effusion 

No vegetation seen  cannot definitively exclude 

  CT CHEST 
CONCLUSION 
  Extensive multifocal consolidation in both lungs which on
review of prior imaging has developed and progressed since the
radiograph of   These findings are most suggestive of
with multifocal pneumonia 
  Incompletely assesed splenomegaly  perisplenic ascites and
inflammatory
change in the mesentry of the upper abdomen

  CT CHEST 
IMPRESSION 
  Extensive patchy air space opacification scattered throughout
both lungs is similar in distribution and extent to CT performed
on   but less dense in most locstions  compatible
with some improvement  The differential diagnosis for this
appearance is broad but includes resolving multifocal pneumonia
or edema 
  Cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites 

  RENAL U S 
FINDINGS  Study is slightly limited secondary to difficulties
with patient
positioning  The right kidney measures   cm  The left kidney
measures   cm  No stones  hydronephrosis  or solid masses are
identified  There appears to be a   cm simple appearing cyst
within the lower pole of the right kidney 
IMPRESSION  No evidence of hydronephrosis

  PORTABLE CXR 
REASON FOR EXAMINATION  Followup of a patient with multifocal
pneumonia 
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to   and
   Numeric Identifier   There is overall no change in the widespread
parenchymal opacities  although compared to more remote studies 
there is some degree of improvement  The NG tube tip is in the
stomach 

  Swallow Study 
Reason for Exam  Concern for aspiration  A swallowing
videofluoroscopy study was done in conjunction with the speech
pathology service  Multiple consistencies of oral barium were
administered  Barium passed beyond the oropharynx without
evidence of obstruction  Upright swallows of thin liquids
resulted in aspiration and thereafter in spontaneous cough 
Further details are found in the online medical record  with the
speech pathologist note from  

  Diagnositc Paracentesis
Reason for Exam  Concern for SBP  Successful ultrasound guided
paracentesis of   cc of yellow serosanguineous fluid  Negative
for SBP 

  EEG
Reason for Exam  Altered Mental Status  This is an abnormal
routine EEG due to a slow and poorly modulated background
indicative of a mild encephalopathy  Medications  metabolic
disturbances  and infections are among the most common causes 
There were no areas of focal slowing although encephalopathies
can obscure focal findings  There was no evidence of
epileptiform discharges noted  Note is also made of a mild
tachycardia on cardiac telemetry 

  Abdominal CT 
Reason for Exam  Rule out recto colovesicular fistula 
Cirrhosis  ascites  fluid containing umbilical hernia  Varices 
Foley and rectal tube adequately placed  No evidence bowel
obstruction 

  Barium Enema  Reason for Exam  Rule out recto colvesicular
fistula  No rectovesicular fistula 


Brief Hospital Course 
Pt is a   year old woman with autoimmune hepatitis on
azathioprine complicated by cirrhosis  portal gastropathy 
esophageal varices  transferred from  Hospital   
with multifocal PNA 

SUMMARY OF MICU COURSE 
  Multifocal pneumonia Respiratory Failure  Patient was treated
for typical and atypical bacteria  including PCP  although this
was stopped after several negative BALs  and tularemia  s p
doxycycline treatment  Viral studies were negative  She was
treated broadly with antibiotics per ID  PICC line was placed
for prolonged IV antibiotics   She had increased respiratory
distress on   failing bipap  and at that time  she and her
family decided to reverse her DNR DNI to full code and thus  she
was intubated and mechanically ventilated   She continued on
mechanical ventilation until   when she was extubated
successfully   She remains on O  supplementation via NC 

  Acute renal failure  Cr noted to increase to   and urine
studies were consistent with pre renal state   She was given
IVFs with some improvement   Renal ultrasound negative for
hydronephrosis   Also ARF likely affected by amikacin  thus 
switched to aztreonam   Improved by transfer to floor 

  Leukopenia  Patient remained leukopenic during much of ICU
course  Heme Onc was consulted for etiology of this leukopenia 
They felt this was likely secondary to azathioprine   Ig levels
were high  thus  no need for IVIG   She was given   dose of
Neupogen and no longer neutropenic 

  Autoimmune hepatitis  Hepatology input appreciated   Continued
on her rifaximin  lactulose   Mental status improved once NGT
placed and increased lactulose dose after extubation 

  Hypernatremia  Resolved with increased free water flushes via
NGT 

  Tooth infection  Patient with dental infection   While in ICU 
deferred further workup with Panorex 

The patient was tranferred to hepatology service on  

Multifocal pneumonia  On transfer  the patient remained on
oxygen supplementation and was slowly weaned off  She remained
afebrile without further need for antibiotic therapy  Tuleremia
is still pending on discharge  This diagnosis is highly unlikely
but should be followed up 

Altered Mental Status  The patient s mental status continued to
wax and wane despite lactulose  which led to the conclusion that
it was not solely due to hepatic encephalopathy but delirium 
Another set of cultures  urine  blood  were sent but remained
negative  A CT head non contrast was performed but showed no
acute processes  Neurology and Psychiatry were consulted to
further work up the patient s change in mental status  Both
consults felt the mental status change was secondary to a
multifactorial delirium  EEG was performed and showed no
evidence of epileptic activity  Without definitive intervention
the patient s mental status improved and is now at baseline per
daughter 

Autoimmune hepatitis  Over the course of admission  the
patient s LFTs slowly increased  Azathioprine was held on
admission  per above  Prednisone therapy was initiated and LFTs
improved on  mg Prednisone  LFTs stabilized and Prednisone was
increased to  mg to further decrease patient s Liver Function
Test 

Possible Rectovesicular Fistula  After transfer to the floor a
dark brown sediment was found in the foley catheter bag  On
examination this sediment appeared to be stool  Urinalysis and
urine cultures were negative for infection  CT of the abdomen
with PO contrast was non conclusive 

Hypernatremia   On the floor the patients hypernatremia
continued while she refused to eat or have a dobhoff tube
placed   NS IV fluid was started and after the patients mental
status improved and she began eating patient s hypernatremia
resolved 

Pancytopenia   Thought to be secondary to azathioprine  so
Azathioprine was held since admission  Pancytopenia has not
resovled since Azathioprine was held  Pancytopenia has been
stable   Leukopenia resolved after neupogen in the ICU  During
the stay B  Folate  and reticulocyte count were all within
normal limits 
 
Asthma   Patient was placed on as needed albuterol ipratropium
nebs and remained stable throughout the hospitalization

IMPRESSION 
  Large subacute left subdural hematoma with subtle components
of more acute subarachnoid blood  exerting significant mass
effect resulting in sulcal and ventricular effacement  left to
right midline shift  and subfalcine and early uncal and early
transtentorial downward herniation 
  No evidence of skull fracture

CT Head  
Status post left craniotomy with expected post surgical changes
and resolving pneumocephalus  Stable rightward shift of midline
structures of approximately   mm  No new acute hemorrhage

CT Head  
Patient is status post left craniotomy and subdural hematoma
evacuation since   with post surgical changes 
Allowing for differences in section selection as well as
measurements between exams  there appears to be stable   mm
rightward shift  However  there is increased effacement of the
left occipital  Doctor Last Name   as compared to   suggestive
of an increased degree of mass effect  Hyperdense material
within the surgical bed along the left craniotomy appears
similar as before  There is no definite evidence for new intra 
or extra axial hemorrhage  Suprasellar and basilar cisterns
remain patent without evidence for herniation  There is
persistent but stable amount of pneumocephalus and subcutaneous
emphysema post operatively  In fact  this appears to be
decreased as compared to   Visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable 
IMPRESSION 
  No new hemorrhage since

FINDINGS  The patient is status post left craniotomy and
subdural hematoma evacuation since   with
expected post surgical changes  Left subdural fluid collection
is unchanged in size with interval decrease in amount of
pneumocephalus  There is persistent sulcal effacement and
compression of the left lateral ventricle  There is a slight
interval decrease in the shift of midline structures  from   mm
to   mm  Hyperdense material underlying the craniotomy site is
slightly decreased in quantity  There is no evidence of new
hemorrhage  The suprasellar and basilar cisterns remain patent
without evidence of herniation  There is layering fluid in the
left maxillary sinus  unchanged since prior examination 
IMPRESSION 
  No new hemorrhage since  
  Slightly decreased   mm rightward shift with unchanged

Brief Hospital Course 
The patient was admitted to the SICU for Q  hour neurochecks 
blood pressure control  and seizure prophylaxis   He did well
overnight   In the morning he was noted to have new right facial
twitching   His Keppra was subsequently increased to   gram  Hospital   
 He was consented and pre oped for the OR   He went for a left
craniotomy for evacuation of the SDH on    He tolerated the
procedure well  and was immediately extubated and brought back
to the ICU   His HOB remained flat  and he was given a non re
breather mask for increased oxygenation   He was nauseated and
vomited twice  but this abated with Compazine   His post op
check was non focal  and his post op head CT did not demonstrate
and post op hemorrhage 

On   he was agitated and not feeling well   He also had
persistent R facial twitching   The decision was made to obtain
an EEG for seizure monitoring  His agitation improved with a
small does of Ativan  and his HOB was slowly raised  he became
much calmer  and had less of a headache 

On   he felt very good  His pain was well controlled  he was
eating a liquid diet  and he was no longer nauseated or
agitated   His neurological exam remained non focal   He was
transferred to the floor for Q  neuro checks  He was seen by
PT OT  Patient has been orthostatic even on fluids and stable
hematocrit  PT will re evaluate patient in the AM 

 Date range     Pt improved mobility and decrease in orthostasis  He
continued to work with PT and OT  who recommended that the
patient be transferred to rehab 

ON   the patient developed acute word finding difficulties 
A stat head CT was obtained  which did not demonstrate any acute
changes   Neurology was consulted for questionable seizure    
EEG leads were placed 

On   medicine and endocrine consults were obtained for the
patient s increasing agitation and confusion and his orthostatic
hypotension  Upon their recommendations we ordered an Echo
cardiogram which revealed normal cardiac function with an EF of
   Cortisol stimulation test showed good adrenal response 
Levels of aldosterone and renin were somewhat low   TSH was  
with normal free T  and borderline low T   Dr   First Name  STitle    from
neurology also saw the patient and reviewed his EEG and noted
continuous focal motor seizures that consisted of facial
twitching  He received a  mg bolus of fosphenytoin 

A definitive underlying cause for Mr   Known lastname   orthostatic
hypotension was not identified  for symptomatic relief  as
recommended by neurology  we instituted an abdominal binder and
TEDS for when the patient gets out of bed   Abdominal binder was
stopped several days later due to patient intolerance 

The patient was transferred to the Medicine service on   for
further work up of his dizziness and orthostatic hypotension 
He was started on Midodrine   mg TID every   hours while
awake  which was eventually titrated up to   mg TID   He
experienced improvement in his orthostasis with the Midodrine 
and was able to sit in a chair without significant symptoms or
blood pressure changes   His orthostatic hypotension improved
while standing and he no longer had a significant blood pressure
drop with standing  but he continued to be very symptomatic and
required assistance with standing   The origin of his persistent
dizziness and lightheadedness is unclear   It is likely related
to deconditioning and lying in bed for a prolonged period of
time and to his head injury and will likely take some time to
resolve   Anti seizure medications may be contributing  but
neurology felt this was less likely   As the patient had no
difficulties with orthostasis and lightheadedness prior to his
head injury  it was felt that diabetic neuropathy was an
unlikely etiology   He would likely benefit from tilt table
testing as an outpatinet   He will need progressive and
agressive physical therapy 

He continued to have focal seizure activity during his stay
which consisted predominantly of right facial twitching   His
right hand twitching resolved by discharge   He was treated with
Keppra and Phenytoin  and followed by Neurology during his stay 
 His mental status has improved significantly  but he continues
to have some residual mild word finding difficulty and
intermittent right facial twitching with occasional
perseveration of phrases while speaking   His Phenytoin levels
remained in the high therapeutic to low supratherapeutic range
and the dose was adjusted accordingly to keep levels between
  per neurology   He will require daily to every other day
Phenytoin levels initially with further dose adjustments   He is
discharged on   mg daily of Phenytoin   Per Neurology recs  if
his dizziness does not improve  consideration can be given to
tapering the Phenytoin to   mg  Hospital    next week with a further
slow taper thereafter   If he develops worsening focal seizure
activity with significantly increased facial twitching  return
of involuntary hand movements  or worsened speech problems  this
medication should not be tapered and starting another
antiepileptic should be considered 

On admission  his glucose was significantly elevated and his
HgbA C on   was    He was newly diagnosed with
Diabetes Mellitus Type   and started on Lantus QHS and a Humalog
sliding scale    First Name   NamePattern     Last Name  un    recommendations  he was transitioned
to oral agents in preparation for discharge and the Lantus was
discontinued   He was discharged on Glipizide ER   mg PO daily
and Metformin   mg PO daily with excellent glucose control
over several days of QACHS monitoring 

The patient reported both urinary and fecal incontinence which
was new since his SDH   Evaluation by Neurology thought it was
most likely urge incontinence given his symptoms and otherwise
unremarkable exam finding   His fecal incontinence improved
somewhat after changing him to a less aggressive standing bowel
regimen  but did not resolve completely   A C diff toxin assay
was negative   He continues to have both urinary and fecal
incontinence  most likely urge incontinence in the setting of
his reduced mobility and possibly neurologic injury 

He developed a pruritic rash on his back which is acneiform in
appearance and likely due to his decreased mobility and heat and
moisture from pressure on his back lying in bed   It does not
have the appearance of a drug rash or zoster   The rash has
remained stable over the last few days   The itching is
significantly improved with Sarna lotion   He may benefit from a
Hibiclens wash and or Tramcinolone cream

INTERNAL MEDICINE INSTRUCTIONS 
You were transferred to the medicine service for treatment of
your orthostatic hypotension and management of your newly
diagnosed diabetes   Orthostatic hypotension is a drop in blood
pressure when standing up which can result in lightheadedness
and dizziness   You were started on a medication called
Midodrine which helps prevent this drop in blood pressure   You
did well with this medication  with improvement in your ability
to sit without symptoms   Although you continued to be
symptomatic while standing  you did not drop your blood
pressure   Some of your symptoms are likely related to the long
time spent lying down in the hospital   Your symptoms should
continue to improve with physical therapy and increased
activity 

You were diagnosed with Diabetes during your hospital stay and
initially treated with Insulin   You were then switched to the
oral diabetes medications Glipizide and Metformin   You blood
sugars were well controlled on these medications  and you will
not need Insulin after discharge   You should continue to take
your Glipizide and Metformin as prescribed 

You were seen by Neurology for focal seizure activity causing
facial twitching and occasional uncontrolled hand movements 
You were started on the anti seizure medications Keppra and
Phenytoin   The levels of these medications are being adjusted
by Neurology  and you will need followup with them after
discharge 

You developed incontinence after your subdural hematoma which
has persisted during your stay   You should urinate on a regular
schedule to keep your bladder empty 

You developed an itching rash on your back   You should continue
to treat this with Sarna lotion for symptomatic relief   A
hibiclens wash or triamcinolone cream may also help this rash 

You are being discharged from the hospital to a rehab facility
for physical therapy and further adjustment of your medications 
 It is important that you participate fully in the rehab program
so that you can gain strength and mobility 

Several followup appointments have been scheduled for you with
Neurosurgery and Neurology   After discharge from rehab  it is
very important that you start seeing a primary care doctor to
help manage your ongoing medical issues   You can call the  Hospital  
 Hospital    clinic at  Telephone Fax     to select a doctor 
 Alternatively  you may wish to select a doctor closer to your
home

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS   The patient is a  year old man
with a history of hypertension and type   diabetes with a
four day history of progressive gait instability  nausea 
vomiting and headache which became progressively worse over
the   hours prior to admission with lethargy and
obtundation   The patient was taken to  Hospital    where
head CT showed a large midline cerebellar hemorrhage with
edema and moderate compression of the fourth ventricle and a
small amount of fresh blood in the posterior horns of the
bilateral ventricles   The patient was then transferred to
 Hospital    for further management 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY   Hypertension   History of polio with
left arm and leg weakness   He uses a cane to ambulate but
has moderate antigravity strength of the left arm 
Hypertension   Diabetes   Glaucoma 

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION   Metoprolol   mg p o  b i d 
Cozaar   mg p o  b i d  enteric coated Glyburide   mg p o

ALLERGIES   NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES 

IMAGING   CT scan from the outside hospital showed a   cm
midline cerebellar hemorrhage with moderate surrounding
edema  fourth ventricle patent  blood in the posterior horns
of the bilateral ventricle 

HOSPITAL COURSE   The patient was admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and was taken
emergently to the Operating Room for decompression of the
cerebellar hemorrhage and placement of a ventricular drain 

He underwent posterior fossa craniotomy for evacuation of the
hematoma and placement of an occipital ventriculostomy drain
without intraoperative complication   Postoperatively the
patient was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit   He was
difficult to examine due to sedation  but he was moving both
lower extremities 

He had a repeat head CT which showed some reaccumulation of
blood in the hematoma bed in the cerebella but no need for
reevacuation  and ventricular drain was in good position 
The patient had his blood pressure controlled with Nipride 
and his ICP was within normal limits  and he was sedated 

On postoperative day   his pupils were   down to   mm and
brisk   He opened his eyes to voice   He moved his legs to
command   Left upper extremity was antigravity   Right upper
extremity had less movement 

The patient was extubated on    On   he
was opening his eyes spontaneously   He was oriented times
three   His pupils were   down to   mm and brisk   He was
following commands and moving the right arm and leg better
then the left  which is his prehospital condition   He was
improving neurologically 

The patient was seen by Speech and Swallow Services and found
the patient to be aspirating  requiring an NG tube for
feeding 

The patient had his vent tube weaned on    The
patient was less interactive  not opening his eyes   He did
follow some commands with some pushing   The patient had a
repeat head CT after the drain was pulled  which did show
hydrocephalus   Therefore  a right frontal ventriculostomy
drain was placed 

On   the patient underwent left VP shunt
placement and removal of right ventricular catheter without
intraoperative complications   The patient postoperatively
showed pupils to be   down to   mm and brisk   He was awake 
attentive  moving upper extremities with antigravity strength
and moving the lower extremities bilaterally   He was not
following commands   His dressing was clean  dry  and intact 
The patient was weaned to extubate on  

On   the patient was following commands 
localizing with the upper extremities bilaterally   His
pupils were symmetric and reactive   He had Doppler studies
which were negative for DVT   He was seen by Physical Therapy
and Occupational Therapy and will require a rehabilitation
stay prior to discharge to home 

On   the patient had an episode of spontaneous
hypotension   He was seen by the Cardiology Service and rule
out for myocardial infarction   He had an echocardiogram but
did not require any further intervention from the Cardiology
Team   His cardiac medications were reconfigured  and he had
no further problems with cardiac issues 

He had several attempts for repeat swallow exam but was too
sleepy to tolerate the test   Therefore  it was decided that
a PEG would be placed  and he would be transferred to
rehabilitation 

The patient also had an episode of hypoglycemia requiring
return to the Intensive Care Unit and intubation   He was
extubated the following day and transferred back to the
regular floor on   in stable condition    Last Name  un   
was consulted  the patient s Insulin regimen was adjusted 

The patient s condition has improved since that episode   He
is awake  alert  following commands  moving all extremities 
but still requiring maximum assistance out of bed

Brief Hospital Course 
Mrs   Known lastname   was transferred to  Hospital    Emergency Room where she
was evaluated by the Trauma team and outside Xrays and scans
were reviewed   She was intubated but responsive and able to
move all   extremities and a cervical collar was in place   She
was transferred to the Trauma ICU for further management 
Following stabilization of her hemodynamics with blood and
fluid  she was taken to Interventional Radiology where she
underwent an angiogram and embolization of the right inferior
vesicular artery   There was focal extravasation from the distal
vesicular branch   Following the procedure she returned to the
ICU where she was weaned and extubated   She had serial
hematocrits checked which stabilized at  
Her cervical collar was removed as her C spine was cleared and
her neurologic status was stable 

The Ortho Trauma service evaluated her pubic rami fractures and
recommended non operative treatment   Her weight bearing status
is partial on the right lower extremity and as tolerated on the
left lower extremity 

Following transfer to the Trauma floor on   she developed
some confusion and her speech was slow   She had a head CT
repeated which was unchanged  carotid studies which were normal
and a formal neurology consult due to her prior history of
TIA s   Her exam was felt to be at baseline after conversing
with her family   An MRI was done but there was no evidence of
any acute process   The neurologist felt that her confusion and
slowness of speech may be due to mild ischemia from her fall in
light of her low hematocrit 

Over a   day period she was much brighter  oriented and
conversant  She developed some expiratory wheezes on exam which
cleared with Albuterol nebulizers  A chest Xray was done which
showed tiny bilateral effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis 
 She subsequently underwent chest PT and incentive spirometry 
She was evaluated by the speech and swallow service prior to
initiating a diet   She had some degree of dysphagia and soft
foods and thin liquids were recommended as well as strict
aspiration precautions 

The Physical Therapy service was active in her treatment in
assisting her out of bed into a chair  She will be transferred
to rehab today for further physical therapy to increase her
mobility and hopefully she can return home independently as
before her fall

include vancomycin and Zosyn at that time   He then
experienced improvement in his oxygen saturation initially 
but was unable to obtain    He had a CAT scan performed 
which further delineated a left lower lobe density that had
been seen on chest x ray   This CAT scan of the chest
demonstrated stenosis of the trachea   The patient was then
transferred to  Hospital    for

IMPRESSION   The patient is a  year old male with multiple
medical problems  who presents with tracheomalacia seen on
chest CT   The patient was transferred from  Hospital   Hospital
to  Hospital    for further workup of
his tracheomalacia  bronchoscopy  and stent placement 

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE FROM   TO    The
rest will be dictated at a later time 

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE BY SYSTEMS 
  Pulmonary   The patient was transferred to the  Hospital    for a bronchoscopy to evaluate his
tracheomalacia   He underwent an initial bronchoscopy on
   He underwent a repeat bronchoscopy with three
stents placed in the LMS  RBI  and distal trachea that
contains silicone on    Cultures from this
bronchoscopy were consistent with inflammation and not
malignancy   He was placed on empiric antibiotics to include
vancomycin  inhaled tobramycin  and intravenous Flagyl for
pseudomonas and MRSA that were isolated from the outside
hospital 

Repeated ABGs were performed  which revealed compensated
chronic respiratory alkalosis consistent with the patient s
history of COPD and bronchiectasis   The patient was weaned
as tolerated to what became his baseline of   on   liters
of oxygen   The Interventional Pulmonology team followed the
patient closely   Patient was started on a steroid taper  and
at the time of this dictation  his prednisone was   mg p o 
q d   He was also maintained on his albuterol and ipratropium
bromide nebulizers with improvement of his symptoms 

  FEN GI   The patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound
at the outside hospital  which revealed no calculi and normal
biliary tree   However  because his liver function tests
continued to trend up and his bilirubin reached a peak of  
a repeat ultrasound was obtained  which is again within
normal limits 

The patient underwent a MRCP  which showed a mass in the head
of the pancreas   The ERCP team was consulted for further
evaluation   At the time of this dictation  the patient is
planned for a potential ERCP if he is cleared by Anesthesia 
His AMA   Doctor First Name   alpha fetoprotein  and hepatitis panel were all
within normal limits except for a hepatitis C viral load of
greater than    A SPEP and UPEP were within normal
limits with no evidence of  Last Name  un   Doctor Last Name   protein   He did have
elevated calcium   carcinoembryonic antigen  and CA 
levels consistent with malignancy 

Patient initially presented with asterixis  which improved
when lactulose titrated up to   bowel movements a day   He
was continued on nadolol for esophageal varices  ursodiol 
and Protonix   The patient was started on a  gram sodium 
low fat  low cholesterol diet   Nutrition consult was
obtained  and the patient was started on a multivitamin  zinc
supplementation  and vitamin C supplementation   He did have
one day of peripheral nutrition   However  since his caloric
count was within normal limits  this was discontinued 

  Cardiovascular   The patient had evidence of congestive
heart failure on admission   He diuresed well and became
euvolemic at the time of this dictation with intravenous
Lasix   The patient s daily weights were stable   He was
continued on his digoxin as his level was within normal
limits   He had an echocardiogram on   which revealed
left atrial and left ventricular wall thicknesses  mild
dilatation of left ventricle  ejection fraction of  
and resting wall motion abnormalities of the septal 
inferolateral  and inferior akinesis with anterior
hypokinesis   There was normal right ventricular chamber
size  severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis 
and moderate to   mitral regurgitation   There is also
moderate size pericardial effusion   Patient was continued on
his home dose of metoprolol 

  Infectious disease   The patient has completed a  day
course of intravenous vancomycin for his
tracheomalacia bronchiectasis  which was found to contain
MRSA and pseudomonas at the outside hospital   These
antibiotics were discontinued on day    However  due to
the rise in white blood cell count on   vancomycin
was restarted   The patient remained afebrile during this
time 

  Hematology   The patient has a normocytic anemia and a
high RDW   There is a mixed picture of GI losses and liver
disease  he has a normal iron level   He was transfused  
unit of packed red blood cells in the Intensive Care Unit for
a low hematocrit   He was found to have an elevated vitamin
B  level 

  Endocrine   The patient had labile blood sugars throughout
his hospitalization   His NPH on admission was   units
q a m  and   units q p m   This was adjusted accordingly
based on his glucose levels   His testosterone patch was
discontinued as it was deemed unnecessary   A TSH level was
checked  which was within normal limits 

  Vascular   The patient had dressing changes of his lower
extremity ulcers with Duoderm and Oxyzal   He also developed
a blister on the dorsum of his left foot  which was lanced
without complication on  

  Renal   The patient was noted to have a poor renal
function with a creatinine clearance of   mL minute  likely
a complication of his type   diabetes   His creatinine was
monitored and remained stable while diuresing with Lasix 

  Psych   Patient expressed feelings of depression   For
this reason  he was started on Celexa   mg p o  q d  x  days
through    He should then be changed to   mg p o 
q d  and follow up with an outpatient Psychiatry as deemed
necessary 

This is a dictation of this patient from   to
   A further dictation for the remainder of the
patient s hospitalization course will follow at a later time

ADDENDUM   Please refer to previous discharge summary for
history of present illness  physical exam  and pertinent
laboratory  x ray  EKG  and other tests on admission  and
initial hospital course up to  

FURTHER HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS 
  Pulmonary   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   On   the patient was felt to be improving and an attempt
   was made to wean the patient down to his baseline
   prednisone dose of   mg q d  from a dose of   mg q d   A
   salmeterol diskus was also started on    On  
   the patient was felt to have increased wheezing and
   increased O  requirement  and as a result was placed back
   on an increased prednisone dose of   mg q d 

On   the patient improved markedly and on day of
discharge the patient was still having diffuse wheeze  but
was felt to be at a optimum pulmonary status given his
underlying disease   The patient should be weaned back to his
baseline prednisone of   mg q d  very slowly  i e  no more
than   mg decrease  no more frequent than every five days 

  GI   A  Pancreatic mass   Initial plan had been to pursue
   ERCP for evaluation of the mass  however  ERCP service
   requested Anesthesia consult given the patient s
   underlying pulmonary and cardiac disease   Anesthesia
   requested further evaluation of the newly diagnosed poor
   left ventricular systolic function   A Cardiology consult
   was obtained and a stress test was recommended   A stress
   test was obtained  but in the meantime a family was also
   obtained to discuss the plan   The family was advised that
   ERCP would have approximately a   percent chance of being
   nondiagnostic and even if diagnostic  the patient would
   likely not be a candidate for aggressive treatment given
   underlying disease   As a result  the patient and family
   opted to forgo ERCP 

B  Hyperbilirubinemia   Scleral icterus continued to improve
and a repeat total bilirubin was noted to be decreased by
half   This improvement after discontinuation of testosterone
was thought to represent that cholestasis had been
testosterone induced and was nonobstructive 

C  Liver disease   The patient was continued on lactulose
until the day of discharge when it was discontinued because
the patient was not felt to have baseline requirement for it 
It can be given prn to ensure approximately two loose stools
per day 

  Cardiac   A  Pump   The patient had an episode of
   increasing O  requirement and increased pulmonary
   edema pleural effusion on chest x ray on    The
   patient s Lasix was changed from   IV q d  to   mg p o 
   q d   The patient diuresed well and was felt to be
   euvolemic at the time of discharge   Given the patient s
   underlying pulmonary disease  patient was thought to be
   unable to tolerate even minimal pulmonary edema and was
   felt to benefit from continued diuresis with Lasix   p o 
   q d   As stated above  the patient also underwent stress
   testing for evaluation of possible etiology of new left
   ventricular dysfunction   Cardiology recommended
   dobutamine stress given patient s inability to tolerate
   exercise and inability to tolerate Persantine given
   pulmonary disease 

Stress testing showed no EKG change or anginal symptoms at
peak stress but nuclear imaging revealed transient ischemic
dilation  moderate partially reversible inferior wall defect 
and global hypokinesis with ejection fraction of   percent 
Cardiology service recommended optimizing medical management
with aspirin and lipid control 

B  Rate   On most recent EKG prior to discharge  the patient
was in atrial fibrillation   Decision was made to restart
Coumadin on the day of discharge   The patient should be
started on   mg q d  with adjustments made according to INR
in the rehab facility   The Lovenox can be discontinued when
the patient s INR has been between   and   for two days 

  ID   The patient had been restarted on Vancomycin on   for an elevation in WBC count   The patient continued
   to remain afebrile without focal signs of infection or
   further increase in WBC counts  so the Vancomycin was
   discontinued on  

On   the patient had a spike in white blood cell count
along with lethargy and confusion   The chest x ray was not
suggestive of further pneumonia   Urinalysis and Clostridium
difficile testing were negative   Blood cultures showed no
growth   The patient was not restarted on antibiotics and the
WBC count continued to improve 

  Heme   The hematocrit remained stable throughout the rest
   of the admission 

  Vascular   The patient continued to have wound care of the
   lower extremity ulcers 

  Renal   Creatinine remained stable for the remainder of
   the admission 

  Psych   The patient s Celexa dose was increased to   mg
   p o  q d  as planned 

  Neurologic   The patient had an episode of lethargy and
   confusion on   in the morning   Neurologic exam was
   nonfocal   ABG revealed no CO  retention and the patient
   was not more hypoxic   No infectious etiology was
   identified   The patient s episode was believed to be
   related to the administration of Celexa  Morphine  and
   Ambien   Morphine and Ambien were discontinued  and Celexa
   administration was changed to before bed dosing 

  Endocrine   The patient continued to have a m 
   hypoglycemia   Evening NPH was discontinued  morning NPH
   was ultimately decreased to   q a m  and the patient was
   switched from a regular to a Humalog sliding scale with no
   q h s  sliding scale   Patient also received D  at   cc
   an hour for one evening on   to prevent
   hypoglycemia   When prednisone dose increased again on   sugar control improved 

Patient then had a high q h s  blood sugar in the  s after
 Location  un    juice on    As a result  the patient was
restarted on q h s  sliding scale   Blood sugars were
otherwise well controlled   The patient will require careful
monitoring of blood sugar and adjustment of insulin regimen 
Special attention should be made to ensure no further
hypoglycemia as patient is weaned down on prednisone   C 
peptide was sent to evaluate for possible insulinoma  but was
still pending at the time of discharge

Brief Hospital Course 
Pt presented with right sided weakness secondary to right
cerebellar hemorrhage  She received vitamin K  FFP and profiline
  to reverse the coumadin and decrease her INR  In the ICU  her
exam was stable  so no interventions were performed  On  
INR was   and   unit FFP was given  She was transferred to
medicine for step down care  She had an asymptomatic episode of
atrial flutter with higher degree of AV block and bradycardia
likely caused by over blockade  It resolved with decreased doses
of her beta and calcium blockers  She was  monitored on
telemetry with no acute events  Her blood pressure was kept
below   systolic for her recent intracranial bleed  She has
been stable with no events on her current doses of long acting
diltiazem and metoprolol  Her oxygen requirement resolved with
incentive spirometry  She was found to have a UTI shown on
culture to be pan sensitive E coli  so she was started on  d
course of Bactrim  Of note  her WBC increased one day after
treatment  but patient remained asymptomatic  so please repeat
urine analysis after completion of antibiotics to confirm
clearance  During this hospitalization  her hand became
ecchymotic and edematous and she complained of severe pain  Work
up was significant for occlusive cephalic venous thrombus  which
is likely causing her symptoms  Given her recent cerebellar
hemorrhage  neurosurgery advised that she not be therapeutically
anticoagulated for this  although SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis
is acceptable and appropriate    Her hand is being managed with
elevation  physical therapy  and pain control with Tylenol 

She will need to follow up with neurosurgery   This was
scheduled

infection  for which we began treatment with an antibiotic  Your
left hand started hurting and was swollen  which is likely
caused by a blood clot in a superficial vein in your arm 
Because of your brain bleed  we cannot thin your blood anymore
than the heparin shots you get three times a day  It will
resolve on its own 

 DO NOT RE START YOUR COUMADIN UNTIL CLEARED BY THE NEUROSURGEON

Take your pain medicine as prescribed 
 Exercise should be limited to walking  no lifting  straining 
or excessive bending 
 Increase your intake of fluids and fiber  as narcotic pain
medicine can cause constipation  We generally recommend taking
an over the counter stool softener  such as Docusate  Colace 
while taking narcotic pain medication 
 Unless directed by your doctor  do not take any
anti inflammatory medicines such as Motrin  Aspirin  Advil  or
Ibuprofen etc 
 If you were on a medication such as Coumadin  Warfarin   prior
to your injury  you may safely resume taking this AFTER YOU ARE
CLEARED TO DO SO IN THE  Hospital   CLINIC 

CALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE
FOLLOWING
 	New onset of tremors or seizures 
 	Any confusion  lethargy or change in mental status 
 	Any numbness  tingling  weakness in your extremities 
 	Pain or headache that is continually increasing  or not
relieved by pain medication 
 	New onset of the loss of function  or decrease of function on
one whole side of your body

which was negative and head CT which showed a hyperdense mass in
the left frontal lobe   She was seen by neurosurgery who
recommended outpatient follow up   She was being prepared for
discharge when she developed a chest pressure in her left chest 
non radiating without diaphoresis  shortness of breath  nausea 
This resolved without intervention   ECG showed TW inversions in
V V  and q waves in V V   There were no old ECGs   Cardiology
was made aware   She was to be admitted to medicine but was
hypotensive to the  s s systolic   She was then admitted to
the ICU

Pertinent Results 
CT HEAD 
FINDINGS  There is gyral hyperdensity involving the high
parasagittal left frontal lobe  with rounded foci of
calcification associated with this  There is suggestion of
minimal subjacent parenchymal hypodensity  which may represent
edema  but no significant mass effect  Elsewhere in the brain 
the parenchyma is normal in attenuation  with normal  Doctor Last Name  white
matter differentiation  There is no hemorrhage  There is no
shift of normally midline structures  There are no abnormal
extra axial fluid collections  The ventricles  sulci  and
cisterns are normal in size and appearance  The visualized bones
demonstrate no acute abnormality  Of note  there is no
hyperostosis adjacent to theaforementioned
left frontal lesion  The right maxillary sinus demonstrates
circumferential mucosal thickening   The remainder of the
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated and
clear 
IMPRESSION  Hyperdense mass involving the white matter and
cortex of the high left frontal lobe  There are rounded foci of
calcification within 
Differential considerations should include oligodendroglioma or
other primary brain malignancies versus meningioma or AVM  MRI
is recommended for further characterization  There is no
significant mass effect  and no associated hemorrhage 
 
MR BRAIN 
  About   x   x   mm measuring arteriovenous malformation in

IMAGING 
ECHO   IMPRESSION  Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function  Mild mitral regurgitation 

CTA   IMPRESSION 
  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage 
  Multiple hypodense areas in centrum semiovale  corona radiata
on right
side and right frontal and parietal lobes which are likely
suggestive of old infarcts 
  No evidence of increased mean transit time or decreased blood
flow noted in the brain on CT perfusion images 
  Complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery from
its origin
until the supraclinoid segment  with no flow in M  and M 
segments of right middle cerebral artery  and A  segment of
right anterior cerebral artery with reconstitution of flow in
the distal branches of the middle cerebral artery 
  Moderate narrowing of the P  and P  segments of the right
posterior
cerebral artery 
    stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery 


CXR   IMPRESSION 
  No acute cardiopulmonary process 
  Mild cardiomegaly 

MRI   IMPRESSION  Acute right PCA territory infarct  The
right PCA is fetal and comes off the right ICA  Thus  due to the
thrombus in the right ICA  the PCA became occluded 


Brief Hospital Course 
Mr   Known lastname   is an   yo male who presented with L sided weakness
and neglect found to have a R PCA stroke 

  NEURO  patient was initially thought to have had a R MCA
stroke based on the hypodensities in the right MCA territory
seen on CT  but once MRI was done it became clear that this was
actually a R PCA stroke likely arterial embolization from ICA
stenosis thrombosis to a right fetal PCA   He was started on ASA
 mg   His family and him were adamant about no interventions
that may require intubation  so he was monitored in the ICU
overnight and then sent to the neurology floor service  His
condition thereafter was stable  His stroke was presumably the
result of a stenotic and thrombosed right ICA which then led to
an atery artery embolization to his fetal PCA which also led to
ischemia in the posterior choroidal artery which supplies the
most posterior part of the posterior limb of the internal
capsule and part of the cerebral peduncle  That explains the
dense left hemiplegia  He was started on aspirin for secondary
prevention 

  Cardiovascular  pt had an echo that showed mild mitral
regurgitation but was otherwise unremarkable   We held his home
antihypertensives as his SBP was intermittently low to the  s
 particularly with pain meds  requiring fluid boluses and one
dose of albumin while in the ICU  He continued to received
fluids on the floor but these were stopped prior to discharge 
He had an ECHO which showed an EF   with mild mitral regurg 

  Endo  his lipids were WNL and his HgA C was   but he was
kept on an ISS while an inpatient to ensure euglycemia 

  Ophthalmology  pt was noted to have irritation and mild
scleral injection of his right eye which he was itchy and mildly
painful  He was seen by ophthalmology who determined that he
likely had superficial irritation and recommended artificial
tears and a follow up appointment in   weeks to document
resolution of his eye findings

Brief Hospital Course 
  Age over     year old woman with history of chronic UTIs and
hypothyroidism who presented to the ED with shortness of breath
and altered mental status  In the ED they felt she was having a
CHF exacerbation based on physical exam with crackles in the
bilateral lung fields and o sat of   on RA  She was placed on
BiPAP and improved to   SHe was given lasix and ceftriaxone
levofloxacin and brought to the ICU  In the ICU she was quickly
weened off of BIPAP and she diuresed significantly to lasix 
Cardiac enzymes were sent and she was noted to have an NSTEMI
with peak CK of   and troponin of about   Medical care was
discussed with the health care proxy and decision was to
medically manage this patient  cardiac catheterization was
declined   She was started on a heparin gtt and medically
managed  She then has some hypotension to SBP of   thought to
be due to over diuresis  She was given some fluid back and her
blood pressure remained stable  Her HCT dropped from the low
thirty range to   After  units of PRBCs her HCT improved to
  She was then transferred to the Cardiology floor   She was
hemodynamically stable on arrival   Remaining hospital course
outlined below 

  NSTEMI  Patient complained of chest pain on morning of
   ECG showed slight worsening of T wave inversions of
lateral leads   Her pain resolved    She complained of chest
pain again at  pm on    Cross coverage resident saw the
patient and ordered another ECG which was similar to the
previous   She was given Aspirin PR and cardiac enzymes were
ordered   The Troponin level elevated from   on   to  
CK levels have trended down from   from   to    The
Gerontology fellow was called and Heparin gtt was started 
Cardiac enzymes have since trended down with CK        
  and Trop T of            It is unlikley that
she has suffered a second NSTEMI given her normal CK values and
relatively unchanged ECG   Heparin gtt has been d c ed as
Troponin leak likely due to strain from Pneumonia in setting of
recent NSTEMI   Ms   Known lastname   will be medically managed for her
CAD as discussed with her daughter  Health care proxy   She
will be discharged on Aspirin  mg daily  Metoprolol  mg PO
BID  Atorvastatin  mg daily  Lisinopril  mg daily 

  Pneumonia   CXR shows increased opacification of Right Lower
Lobe   Ms   Known lastname   has been evaluated by the speech and
swallow team here at  Hospital    and was deemed NPO given aspiration
risk   Given concern for aspiration pneumonia  Levofloxacin and
Flagyl have been started for treatment of her pneumonia   She is
currently afebrile with a normal WBC count   She is to complete
a   day course for her pneumonia 

  Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure  ECHO done here at  Hospital   
which showed an LVEF    She was initially admitted with fluid
overload and has now been diuresed to euvolemic status   She is
to continue on Furosemide  mg daily   Her volume status should
be monitored at her rehab facility as changes may be needed
based on her volume status 

  Dementia   Patient answers questions with one word responses 
at other times she does not answer questions at all   Spoke with
the daughter who believes that her mother is doing better 
According to the daugher  Ms   Known lastname   is basically non verbal
at baseline   She speaks very little and does not understand
english very well as she speaks Lithuanian 

  Hyponatremia  Patient initially presented with hyponatremia
likely from CHF   Initial Sodium levels were in the  s  they
have since trended up and are now   on discharge 

  Anemia  Patient was initially anemic with HCT to   while in
the ICU and she is now s p   units of PRBC s   Her HCT has
trended up and stabilized   HCT is now   on dishcharge 

  Hypothyroidism  Continue levothyroxine 

  Nuttrition   Speech and swallow evaluated the patient and
recommended the patient be kept NPO given her poor swallowing
function and risk for aspiration   Recommendation was for a
nasointestinal feeding tube which has now been placed
successfully   The first feeding tube was pulled by the patient 
 This problem was discussed with her daughter and the decision
by the daughter was to place hand restraints to prevent the
patient from pulling her feeding tube once again   She has now
been placed on hand restraints to protect her from removing the
feeding tube   Nutrition has been consulted and made
recommendations for tube feedings which are Nutren   Full
strength  Beneprotein  gm day   Start feeds at  ml h then
advance by  ml per hour for a goal of  ml hr   Residual Check
q h and hold feeds for residual of    ml   Flush feeding tube
with  ml of water q h 

  Prophylaxis   Mr   Known lastname   is currently bed bound and is at
high risk for Deep Vein Thrombosis   Patient to continue on
Heparin   unit SQ TID   She has also been started on
omeprazole for GI prophylaxis with feeding tube

Brief Hospital Course 
Mr   Known lastname   presented to the  Hospital    on   with a right knee
that was swollen and painful  In the ED  the patient s knee was
tapped revealing purulent fluid   Due to the appearance of the
fluid  there was concern for lyme vs  septic joint   Due to some
hypotension and tachycardia in the ED  the patient was admitted
to the ICU for monitoring  Later on the   the
patient was taken to the operating room and underwent an
arthroscopic right knee washout   He tolerated the procedure
well  was extubated  transferred to the recovery room  and then
to the floor   On the floor he was seen by  Month  only    disease
and was started on IV vancomycin and clindamycin  cephalosporins
were avoided due to a potential cephalosporin allergy   On
  he was noted to be tachycardiac and hypotensive   He
was given   liters of fluid bolus due to fluid volume deficit 
A TTE was done and was normal   He was transferred to the SICU
for further care and closer monitoring of his blood pressures 
At this point  the cultures had grown out Group A strep and
there was a high suspicion for toxic shock syndrome   On
  he returned to the operating room and underwent an open
right knee I D washout   He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred back to the SICU because he continued to be
hypotensive and tachycardic   Due to lack of substantial
clinical improvement  on   he returned to the operating
room and underwent another open I D of his right knee   He
tolerated the procedure well was extubated  transferred to the

hemodynamically stable   On   he had a PICC line placed
for long term antibiotics  His hemovac drain was removed from
his knee   On   his clindamycin was discontinued and his
vanc dose was adjusted so he could go home on  Hospital    dosing   and
his vanc trough was   at this dose   He was seen by physical
therapy to improve his strength and mobility range of motion

   Reccurent chest pain in   recathed which revealed
native  VD  and occulsion of   bypass grafts with SVG RCA 
distal occlusion of sequential SVG to Ramus to OM  to OM  with
  stenosis of touchdown on the OM  and occlusion of SVG
proximal to OM   Patent LIMA  distal LAD  collaterals present
to distal RCA  He was treated medically and did well until  
days ago and presented to MWH   with mulitple episodes of
angina and several episodes of nocturnal rest angina  New ST
depression in V V  and CPK   MB  Trop   He underwent
diagnostic cath   which revealed an EF of   with old
inferobasal and new anterolateral and mid inferior hypokinesis 
LVEDP   mmHg  Cors showed native  VD with occlusion of the
SVG RCA and SVG Ramus OM OM  Patent LIMA LAD but there is a
new high grade occlusion distal to the touchdown site   At OSH
patient was started on integrillin and IV heparin  Dr  Last Name  STitle

The night prior to transfer he developed a nose bleed and
integrillin was stopped but heparin gtt was continued  He was
transferred to  Hospital    for high risk Impella supported LAD
intervention  During his cath he had   DES placed to the
circumflex and POBA to LAD  His LIMA to LAD is patient but he
has a   distal occlusion of the LAD  Of note he received  cc

Discharge Instructions 
Dear Mr  Known lastname  

You were admitted for chest pain which required us to perform a
cardiac catheterization  We placed two stents   Following this
procedure  your kidneys were damaged because of the side effect
of the contrast dye that we use during catheterization   Because
your kidneys were having trouble  you built up a lot of fluid in
your lungs that made it difficult for you to breathe   We helped
support your breathing while your kidneys improved   At time of
discharge  your kidneys had returned to near normal and your
breathing had considerably improved   You experienced some
nosebleeding because of one of the medications we started for
stents  we have given you a phone number to call after discharge
so that you can see the Ear Nose Throat doctors to prevent
 Name   PTitle    from happening in the future 
 
We made the following medication changes during this
hospitalization 
  Please STOP taking atenolol   Instead of this blood pressure
medicine  you should START taking metoprolol XL   mg daily 
  STOP taking lisinopril until your primary care doctor or
cardiologist decide to restart this 
  STOP taking allopurinol until your primary care doctor or
cardiologist decide to restart this 
  START prasugrel   mg daily   It s important you take this
medicine because it prevents clots from forming in your stents 
  START lasix   mg daily  until your primary care doctor
tells you to stop this   This prevents fluid from building up in
your lungs 
  Use Afrin spray  oxymetolazone  as needed for nose bleeds 
If you experience a nose bleed  spray your right nostril once
with Afrin  lean forward  and pinch the nostrils for   minutes 
 Call your primary care doctor and let him know   You can use
Afrin up to   times a day 
  You can take benadryl as needed to help you to sleep   mg
at night 
 
You will need follow up appointments as described below 

Followup Instructions 
 Please follow up with your primary care doctor within   week of
discharge  call  Telephone Fax     to set up this appointment 
 Please follow up with your cardiologist within   week of
discharge 
 Please follow up with the Ear Nose Throat doctors as
recommended by your primary care physician    Name   NameIs    you are unable
to set this up with them  you can call  Telephone Fax     to set up
an ENT appointment with us here at  Hospital

his nursing home until     day PTA  when he had diarrhea
with BRBPR throughout the night  He denied abdominal pain 
nausea  and vomiting  He had one episode of dizziness but denied
presyncope or syncope  The BRBPR continued until the morning  He
was transferred to the ED 

In the ED  initial VS were  HR     He denied
nausea vomiding and abdominal pain  On exam  he had BRB in

symptoms  as above  that could be attributed to this  it was
decided to treat c  diff with   weeks of metronidazole   Flagyl
course will be completed on  

  Fecal incontinence 
SYmptoms improved in the hospital  but not completely resolved 
Scheduling GI followup to reassess   He was started on
cholestyramine by prior rehab doctors   Unclear if it is

  Pericardial Effusion   Echo noted moderate pericardial
effusion without signs of tamponade   It was done on   and was
repeated on   and was found to be unchanged at that time 
We suspect that this effusion is a sequelae of his valve
surgery   He will have follow up with his CT surgeon 
 
  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with RVR 
The etiology of the patient difficult to control AF was
multifactorial related to LGIB  d c of diltiazem and untreated
c  difficile   CHADS  score of   on coumadin at home  INR
supratherapeutic on admission  initially reversed with vitamin K
and FFP  but continued home metoprolol for rate cotrol   After
further discussion with the patients Cardiologist  ASA was
discontinued because the patient had a normal catheterization 
His anticoagulation was resumed after his GI bleeding was
resolved  and his INR was in the therapeutic range on day of
 Month Day      The patient was trialed on single  Doctor Last Name   metoprolol
in house for rate control but this was not effective with HR in
the   range without symptoms   The inpatient Cardiology
team was consulted and they ultimately recommended diliazem  
CD which improved his rate control   His heart rate was
controlled with diltiazem CD   mg po daily and metoprolol
tartrate   mg po daily   He had occasional PVCs  so please
check his potassium and magnesium at least twice a week  can be
done with cyclosporine labs 
 
  VOLUME OVERLOAD with a h o sCHF with recent EF  
Patient had elevated JVP and periperhal edema  suggestive of
elevated R filling pressures  Lasix  HCTZ were held  however  in
context of recent bleed   Once the patient showed no further
episode of GIB  Cardiology was consulted and they rec d IV
diuresis   This helped improve the patient AF control and he was
transitioned to his home dose of lasix    He should not continue
hydrochlorothiazide 
 
  S P RENAL TRANSPLANT  Renal consulted re immunosuppression
regimen   He was continued on cyclosporine   mg po daily and
prednisone   mg po daily   Per the renal staff  diltiazem can
interact with cyclosporine  so if that medicine is discontinued

a vague opacity in the right mid lung   The contour of the
cardiac and mediastinal structures is unchanged   Pulmonary
vascularity is within normal limits   There are no pleural
effusions   Osseous structures again demonstrate mild
degenerative changes of the spine 
IMPRESSION   New hazy opacity in the right mid lung is
concerning for

CTA chest     The right thyroid lobe is largely replaced by
multiple
nodules  the largest of which measures   x   mm  unchanged
from  
There are no filling defects within the pulmonary artery

effusion  There is a tiny left pleural effusion with left lower
lobe compressive atelectasis   Scatterd areas of air space
consolidation in the posterior right upper lobe  right middle
lobe  left lung base and  most prominently  right lower lobe are
consistent with multifocal pneumonia   Ground glass opacity in
the right middle and anterior right upper lobes support an
underlying infectious etiology   Global bronchial wall
thickening is unchanged   The airways are patent to the
subsegmental level bilaterally  Imaging of the upper abdomen is
not sufficient for diagnosis   A small hiatal hernia is again
noted   Multiple low attenuation lesions within the liver
parenchyma are unchanged since   and likely represent simple
cysts

Brief Hospital Course 
  y o F with NHL currently receiving abd radiation to lymph
node  p w persistent fevers despite   courses of levofloxacin
and found to have multi focal PNA 
 
  Fevers  Due to multifocal PNA seen on imaging on admission 
Given her prior failed treatment courses with levaquin  this was
concerning for resistant organisms  atypical or fungal organism 
or possible recurrent aspiration  Furthermore  an IVIG level was
checked  which was low  Thus  the pt may have been unable to
effectively clear the pneumonic process  She was admitted to the
 Hospital Unit Name   intially given concern for hypoxia given her  L NC oxygen
requirement was placed on ceftriaxone and azithromycin  The
following day  a blanching maculopapular rash was noted over the
torso and upper thighs  which was concerning for a drug rash 
Ceftriaxone was discontinued and meropenem started  Sputum cxs
were negative for fungus  PCP   Name   NameIs    AFB smear negative  Urine
legionella negative  The pt underwent a bronch for BAL that
showed   GPC in pairs  GNRs  no fungus  neg  legionella  There
was a question of TE fistula on the admission CT scan after
further review with the MICU attending  but there no evidence of
TE fistula was seen on bronch  A speech and swallow consult was
negative for OP aspiration  The pt was weaned off her O 
requirement and transferred to the BMT service for further care 
  mg kg of IVIG was given  ID was consulted who recommended
treatment with a   day course of ertapenem and azithromycin 
She was discharged in good condition and will complete the
course of azithromycin at home and will come into the  Hospital  
clinic daily to receive an infusion of ertapenem to finish a  
day course 
 
  Lymphoma  With recurrence of disease  Was scheduled to
undergo   more session of radiation with Dr   Last Name  STitle    as an
outpatient  which the pt completed  cycles   and   out of  
as an inpatient  During the hospital course  the pt did not
require any blood product transfusions to keep her hct    
plts    K  She will follow up with Dr   First Name  STitle    as an outpatient 
 
  Dysphagia  The pt reported worsening dysphagia over the past
year with solids   Had an EGD in   that showed a widely
patent Schatzki s ring without other abnormalities  GI was
consulted who recommended a barium swallow study which showed
distal obstruction at the GE junction  She underwent an EGD the
following day in which a Schatski s ring was dilated  Findings
in the antrum suggestive of chronic gastritis were also seen 
She will follow up with Dr   Last Name  STitle    as an outpatient 
 
  HTN  HCTZ held on admission and was restarted by the time of
discharge

Brief Hospital Course 
Hospital Course by systems 

  CV  Developed rapid atrial fibrillation on two occasions 
First time converted spontaneously and was controlled with
metoprolol IV   The second time  J conversion was needed and
amiodarone used for maintenance   Cardiac enzymes and
echocardiogram were essentially normal  borderline PA HTN   No
anticoagulation started as she converted within   hours on both
occasions 

  Respiratory   She was intubated following each of her
surgeries   When fit for extubation  she had no complications 
She developed metabolic alkalosis on lasix gtt  used to decrease
bowel edema prior to closure  without any significant untoward
effects   Two CTA studies to evaluate for PE were negative 
Pulmonary nodules possibly c w metastatic disease were seen on
multiple studies   Possible aspiration occured on   based
on CXR findings 

  GI  Fecal drainage per vagina noted approximately   weeks
postop   On   CT revealed collection at rectal
anastomosis   In abscence of signs of peritonitis  she was
managed conservatively with IV antibiotics
 Levofloxacin Metronidazole  NPO  and TPN for approximately  
weeks   Overall she improved  but continued to have stool
drainage and nausea   A new fluid collection developed in the
right abdomen   A percutaneous drain was placed and symptoms
improved   A low residue diet was attempted but patient
continued to have vomiting and therefore returned to OR for
ostomy for stool diversion 
  Pt was followed by general surgery after ileostomy for
managment of her abdominal wound dressings including a vac
dressing   An alloderm closure was attempted on  
Abdominal fistulas with drainage of feculent material devloped
on POD   Necrotic tissue on the wound was noted   The alloderm
closure had multiple defects   A modified low suction vacuum
dressing was applied with occlusive dressing to aid in keeping
wound area clean from fecal drainage   No overt signs of sepsis
 hemodynamically stable  WBC stable  low grade fever only  blood
culture NGTD   However  given multiple fistulas and no
effective surgical medical management  hospice services were
offered and palliative care consult obtained   She was
tolerating fluids at time of discharge   TPN was discontinued
given wishes for hospice care 

  GU  Initially elevated creatinine returned to baseline level
of   by POD 
Peritoneal fluid collection developed near urostomy site  see
above   Loopogram and repeated creatinine levels of drained
fluid were not consistent with a urostomy leak   Urology
followed patient throughout her hospital course   Ileal conduit
continues to work well 

  ID  Patient received levofloxacin and metronidazole for
empiric coverage in setting of rectal anastomotic leak   She had
several courses of levofloxacin flagyl but this was discontinued
completely on    Vancomycin was started on   for
enterococcus in fluid from abdomen and increased WBC 
Vancomycin was discontinued on    hospice 

  Heme  pt received multiple transfusions throughout her stay 
Her Hct continued to trend down to baseline    Laboratory
studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease   Procrit was
started on   and discontinued prior to discharge
 hospice 

  Endocrine  Synthroid was continued at outpatient doses   TSH
was elevated twice  peak   but T  was normal borderline so
dose was not changed 

  Mental Status changes  Pt was confused and disoriented on
   TSH elevated   and possible aspiration as described
above   Changes thought to be secondary to pain medication
changes  starting methadone   Returned to baseline mental
status after discontinuing methadone   Pain controlled on
oxycodone  lexapro  ativan  and prn SL morphine at time of
discharge to hospice 

 Patient was discharged to hospice on Hospital Day   and

Thalidomide in   He received monthly Pamidronate from the
time of diagnosis to   when he was switched to Zometa  He
continued thalidomide until   when it was stopped due to
debilitating symptoms of ataxia and peripheral neuropathy  He
continued monthly Zometa until   when he was switched to
every other month  In   the Zometa was stopped for
concern of right lower jaw osteonecrosis  Mr   Known lastname   was off all
therapy for his myeloma since that time  Bone marrow biopsy done

were   of marrow cellularity  Kappa restricted  He started a
Decadron burst on   After this first cycle of Decadron
he developed an infection in his mouth and lower extremity
weakness so he did not start his second cycle until   He
started cycle   Velcade on   He had radiation to the

sepsis with unclear source  EMG showed diffuse complicated
neuropathy  The Bence  Doctor Last Name   Proteins in his urine were
negligible since he received his last cycle of Velcade until
  when they again begain to rise  His FLR also began to rise
at that time  As his UPEP began to double and FLR rose  the

Brief Hospital Course 
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE 
  year old with paroxysmal afib  h o superior mesenteric vein
thrombosis on coumadin since   chronic renal insufficiency
 baseline Cr   and MM diagnosed in   on Revlimid
therapy  last dose   or   recently diagnosed UTI on
Cipro  awoke on the day of admission with new weakness  SOB and
malaise  Found to have multifocal PNA  likely parainfluenza in
origin   The patient had a brief stay in the ICU  and recovered
significantly over the course of the hospital stay after
stabilization in the ICU 

ACUTE ISSUES 
  PNA Bronchitis  Pt presented with acute onset SOB and cough
and had CXR findings c w multifocal PNA  He was started on
vancomycin and Levaquin in the ED  Due to low suspicion for
HCAP  his antibiotics were subsequently changed to aztreonam and
Levaquin based on the patient s history of anaphylaxis with
penicillins  Rapid viral testing was sent which came back
positive for parainfluenza virus  As a result  the patient was
placed on contact precautions   Name   NI    was febrile on presentation 
Multiple blood cultures and urine cultures were drawn  all of
which returned no growth  He spiked a new fever on   He was
wheezing on presentation which improved with nebulizers  The
patient was discharged from the ICU on  L nasal cannula   He
quickly improved over the course of days  and was ultimately
discharged to home on room air  saturating in the mid  range
and comfortable  The patient completed   total days of
antibiotics 

  Pulmonary Edema CHF  On   patient was given IVF due to low
urine output of prerenal etiology  FENa   He developed
acute SOB with wheezing and rales on exam and dropped his O  sat
to   during the episode thought to be due to diastolic CHF 
The patient s most recent echo in   showed preserved EF but
moderate AS with LVH  His respiratory status and SOB improved
with Lasix and doses of IV morphine   The patient had no other
issues of pulmonary edema after this episode 

  Mouth pain  Patient with significant mouth pain during
hospitalization  attributable to his known osteonecrosis of the
jaw   He used his home chlorhexadine mouthwash  cephasol and
also lidocaine containing mouthwash for symptomatic relief   The
patient was evaluated by the oral and maxillofacial surgery team
during the admission  who deferred surgical or aggressive
management until outpatient  but did advise on symptomatic
control 

  SIRS Hypotension  Pt was hypotensive in the ED but responsive
to fluid boluses and did not require pressors  He remained
responsive to fluid boluses throughout his stay  Pressures were
stable at the time of transfer to the floor on    He
required no more fluid boluses after arriving on the OMED  Hospital   

  Decreased UOP  The patient initially presented to the ICU with
dysuria  dribbling stream and difficulty urinating  He was seen
by his PCP  Last Name  NamePattern      where he reportedly had a positive UA and was
started in Cipro  He was unable to provide a urine sample on
arrival to the ED on   but began to have good UOP once he
arrived in the  Hospital Unit Name   Pt s residual volumes were   on
bladder scan and it was determined that he Most likely required
more fluids in the setting of insensible losses   fever and
general decreased PO intake over the past few days  He was given
 cc of crystalloid and developed pulmonary edema as described
above   The patient s foley catheter was removed on   and
he passed his voiding trial  with normal urine output 

  UTI  Pt  on Cipro for a UTI diagnosed at an outside facility 
Cultures here were negative but he is covered for urinary
pathogens with Levaquin  which he received for a total of   days
during this hospitalization  A Foley was placed to monitor
urine output during diuresis after pulmonary edema developed 
which was succesfully discontinued prior to his discharge 

STABLE ISSUES 
  Anticoagulation  Pt on Coumadin for superior mesenteric vein
thrombosis in   His INR was monitored while in the  Hospital Unit Name   and
his Coumadin was dosed appropriately  keeping in mind that
antibiotics can affect the metabolism of warfarin   His INR was
stable on discharge 

  Multiple Myeloma  Pt  on Revlimid therapy which was held in
the setting of infection  Dr   Last Name  STitle    came to see the patient
and is concerned about his clinical course especially within the
setting of this new infection  Followup will be needed with
outpatient oncologist as patient was in the middle of a cycle
and we stopped his treatment upon diagnosis of UTI

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size  No atrial septal defect is
seen by  D or color Doppler  There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy  The left ventricular cavity size is
normal  There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with antero lateral hypokinesis  No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle  There is no ventricular
septal defect  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal  The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level  The aortic valve is not well seen  There is no
valvular aortic stenosis  The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output  Moderate   aortic
regurgitation is seen  The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened  Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified   Mild to moderate  The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation  The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened  There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension  There is no pericardial effusion  EF  
Compared with the prior study  images reviewed  of  
regional LV systolic dysfunction is new 

CXR   IMPRESSION   Since moderate cardiomegaly has
worsened  it is possible that increased caliber to the upper
mediastinum  particularly to the right  could be due to venous
engorgement   There is no way that I can exclude a small
mediastinal hematoma  but it would be reasonable to follow this
with conventional radiographs rather than jump to a chest CT
scan   There is no pneumothorax   Atelectasis  due in part to
large hiatus hernia  is slightly more pronounced today than
before   There is no pleural effusion 

CXR   Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction
or the upper right atrium  There is no pneumothorax   There is
moderate cardiomegaly   There are low lung volumes   There is a
large hiatal hernia   Bibasilar opacities are improved  more so
on the right consistent with increasing atelectasis and small
bilateral pleural effusions   There is moderate pulmonary edema 



Brief Hospital Course 
  year old male with TIDM  aortic insufficiency  CKD  and
anemia presents with chest pain hyperglycemia 

  Acute Coronoary Syndrome  NSTEMI with troponin trend   to
peak at   CKMB     EKG with ischemic changes  T wave
flattening in III and AVF  T wave inversions in V V  RBBB and
first degree block unchanged from prior  Echo showed mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
antero lateral hypokinesis  EF   In the ED he was bolused
with heparin and placed on heparin gtt  In the ICU was given
atorvastatin  ASA  mg  IV metoprolol  and nitro gtt 
Cardiology was consulted  and the decision was made to forego
catheterization in order to preserve kidney function  The
patient s chest pain resolved and no further ST changes were
noted on EKG  His heparin gtt was discontinued after he was
discovered to have GI bleed   He had no further chest pain or
arrythmias during the rest of the hospitalization   He was fluid
overloaded and required Lasix IV diuresis before being
transitioned to his home diuretic regimen   He was sent home on
atorvastatin  mg  ASA  mg  carvedilol  mg  Hospital    plavix  mg
daily   He will follow up with Dr   Last Name  STitle    his outpatient
cardiologist  He was discharged with a weight of  kg  
 lbs 

 DKA  His course was complicated by DKA likely triggered by the
acute MI  Initial anion gap   K   glucose   bicarb   He
was resucitated with IV NS and ICU insulin protocol 
Afterwards  his gap closed  was transitioned to SQ insulin with
K repletion  Bicarb remained low and responded to sodium bicarb
IVF replacement   Subsequently  he was followed by  Last Name  un   
service to titrate his home insulin regimen   The final regimen
is Lantus  units qam and   units qpm   He will follow a sliding
scale at breakfast  lunch  dinner  and bedtime  New sliding
scale includes      units      unit       Units
     units      units       units 

  GI Bleed  Patient s crit dropped from   to   in  
hours  given   units with appropriate response  Heparin gtt was
stopped  Hospital day   crit again dropped  required   unit with
appropriate response  A central line was placed and GI was
consulted  EGD was initially deffered as the bleed was not
considered life threatening and preference was to avoid cardiac
stress of procedure outweighing stress of anemia  The patient
has a history of upper GI bleed and had been off ASA before
admission  He has a baseline anemia due to CKD with a crit in
the low  s  Plavix and ASA were held  then restarted  along
with IV PPI   His Hct has since remained stable   EGD
showed gastritis for which he was continued on omeprazole  mg
 Hospital     He will follow up with gastroenterology for follow up of
his GI bleeding and outpatient colonoscopy 

  CHF exacerbation  He has a history of diastolic CHF and
developed upper and lower extremity edema after his NSTEMI   He
was also found to desaturate with repositioning  requiring
diuresis with IV Lasix boluses   On discharge he was restored to
his home diuretic regimen   It is important that he has daily
weights at the  Hospital   rehab to ensure he remains euvolemic 
He was discharged with a weight of  kg    lbs  If he gains
 lbs daily  he should be seen urgently by his cardiologist Dr 
 Last Name  STitle   

  HTN  In context of his NSTEMI  his home BP meds were initially
held and he was started on a nitro gtt  lisinopril  mg daily 
nifedipine  mg q  metoprolol  mg q  and lasix  Weaned off
nitro gtt in ICU   Thereafter he was hypertensive with SBPs to
 s requiring uptitration of his BP meds  On discharge he was
uptitrated to felodipine  mg daily  Lasix  mg po daily 
Hydralazine  mg TID  Lisinopril  mg  Hospital    and carvedilol  mg
 Hospital     This should be further uptitrated by the physicians at
 Hospital   rehab as necessary 

  Chronic renal failure   baseline cr around   admitted at
  with bun in  s in the context of dehydration from DKA 
Likely acute prerenal on top of chronic disease from HTN and DM 
Cr trended down to   in the ICU and remained at that level
until discharge 

  Hyponatremia  Likely multifactorial  including
pseudohyponatremia in DKA  Na initially   corrected at  
when accounting for hyperglycemia  Improved to baseline mid
 s with IVF  No further instances of hyponatremia 

  Gait instabiltiy  He requires assistance with ambulation and
transfers  He was seen by PT who recommended  Hospital  
rehabilitation 

  Candidal esophagitis   This was visualized on EGD  no biopsy
taken   He was started on a   week course of fluconazole  mg
which he should continue daily 

  Aortic Insufficiency  stable 

 Hypothyroidism  stable  he continued levothyroxine

Transitional Issues 
 Pt was discharged with volume status slightly positive  with a
discharge weight of XX  We did not want to achieve firm
euvolemia because of his recent NSTEMI   Will continue him on
his home diuretic regimen   However  it is important that he
have daily weights taken at  Hospital   rehab   If his weight
increases by more than   lbs in one day or there is noticeable
increase in his leg swelling  he should be seen by Dr   Last Name  STitle   
urgently 
   Hospital   rehab for physical therapy need
  Recent changes in BP meds were made and should be uptitrated
as needed by his PCP

Dear Mr   Known lastname  

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted to
 Hospital     You were admitted with chest pain and found to have a
heart attack   For this you were treated with blood thinners and
other medications   However this treatment was discontinued
because you were found to have gastrointestinal bleeding   You
required multiple blood transfusions to stabilize your blood
levels   You tolerated this well and your blood levels have
remained stable 

Additionally  the gastroenterology doctors performed  Name   PTitle    upper
endoscopy and found gastritis  inflammation of your stomach  and
a slight yeast infection of your esophagus   For these issues
you were treated with Omeprazole  a medication to reduce the
acid levels in your stomach  and fluconazole  a medication to
treat the yeast infection of your esophagus 

Your blood sugars were also elevated and you required
intravenous fluids and close management to bring your sugars
back to normal limits   Your insulin regimen was readjusted by
the diabetes specialists at  Last Name  un     You will continue on this
regimen at home   Specifically you will take a long acting
insulin  Lantus   units in the morning and   units at bedtime 
You will also check your sugars before every meal and take a
shorter acting insulin if necessary   This is discussed in more
detail in the medication section of the discharge 

Lastly  we have adjusted your medication to keep your blood
pressure under control   Please refer to the next page for these
medication changes

Brief Hospital Course 
The patient was taken to the OR for an attempt to use a burr
hole to evacuate the subdural hematoma  Unfortunately  multiple
membranes were encountered and the repeat head CT did not show
significant improvement of the subdural hematoma  Based on that
and after discussion with the family  it was decided to take the
patient back to the operating room to perform a large craniotomy
for evacuation of the subdural and also removal of the subdural
membranes  The patient was monitored in the ICU postoperatively 
then transferred to the stepdown unit on post op day   He went
into atrial fibrillation  Diltiazem was initiated  and he was
transferred back to the ICU  He had one episode of a  second
pause in the ICU  Diltiazem was discontinued and an Amiodarone
drip started  He converted back to normal sinus rhythm  The
patient was asymptomatic throughout this episode of dysrhythmia 
A transthoracic echo revealed an EF     MR  mild
symmetric LVH  The patient was given oral Amiodarone and he was
transferred to the floor on post op day   Please evaluate
pateint thyhroid function  liver functions  and eye exam
periodically while on amiodarone Coumadin can be started   weeks
from surgery date on  
He was evaluated by PT OT who recommended discharge to

Brief Hospital Course 
Mr   Known lastname   is a   man with Down s Syndrome  DMII  ESRD  HTN and
Hyperlipidemia who  presented with evolving SVC syndrome over
the last  hrs vs chronic clot   His sister  who is his HCP  had
noticed that he had upper extremitiy and facial swelling over
the past week but had acutely worsened over the   hours prior
to admission   He was taken to  Hospital      weeks
prior to admission for changing of his left IJ over a wire  had
transient hypotension and had been started on a steroid taper 


  SVC syndrome
His presentation  face and upper extremity swelling  was
concerning for SVC syndrome   He showed no signs of respiratory
compromise   He had a CT done that showed a clot in left
subclavian with with SVC filling due to collaterals suggestive
of chronic nature   A heparin drip was initiated in the ED   As
he was stable he was initially admitted to the medical floor 
however clinically he had acute swelling of his face which
continued to worsen despite heparin therapy   He was transferred
to MICU for close observation   He was taken to angio the
following day to explore whether a stent could be placed but
clot was visualized in the right and left IJ and subclavian and
no stent could be placed   He was continued on the heparin gtt
and began to improve clinically   He was started on coumadin and
transferred to the floor   He was discharged home with VNA
services once INR theraputic   INR supratheraputic at   on
discharge  no concern for bleeding  and his HCP was advised to
hold his coumadin for   hours and follow up with coumadin
clinic at PCP s office for dosing    Hospital   clinic follow up
arranged prior to d c   He will need life long anticoagulation 


  End stage renal disease  Throughout his hospitalization his
electrolytes  acid base  fluid status remained relatively
stable   He continued to be dialyzed through his L subclavian
dialysis catheter which was surrounded by clot   He was
continued on his outpatient schedule of dialysis  M W T F   He
was continued on nephrocaps  calcium acetate  sevelamer 
Dialysis team was in contact with his outpatient nephrologist

a history of coronary artery disease  peptic ulcer disease 
congestive heart failure  and diabetes mellitus who presents
with two weeks of melena and lightheadedness 

Five days prior to admission  the patient had an episode of
coffee grounds emesis   He also recalls some dyspnea on

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS   Review of systems reveals no chest pain 
abdominal pain  dysuria  fever  chills  or sweats   He
recalls a fall without loss of consciousness prior to the
melena   He has had stress from his daughter s death back in
   He admits to taking an aspirin per day for the
past   years   The patient quit smoking   years ago with a
 pack year history and quit drinking   years ago 

In the Emergency Department  the patient s fingerstick blood
sugar levels were around the  s  so he was given   units of
insulin subcutaneously    units of insulin intravenously  and
put on a  units per hour insulin drip   He was also given
normal saline   An order was placed for packed red blood
cells because his hematocrit was   and Gastroenterology was
contact Name  NI     Though he was guaiac positive  the gastric lavage
revealed no blood or clots 

While in the Emergency Department  he had electrocardiogram
changes with ST depressions in leads I  aVL  V  V  and V 
Therefore  the patient was given an aspirin

without lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention 
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm   Normal first heart sound and second heart sound   A
  systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border
without radiation   Chest revealed crackles at the bases
heard bilaterally   The abdomen was soft  nontender  and

RADIOLOGY IMAGING   Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus
rhythm with heart rate of   normal axis   mm ST
depressions in leads I  aVL  V  V  and V 

A chest x ray showed bibasilar patchy opacities that may be
consistent with some pulmonary edema 

HOSPITAL COURSE 

   GASTROINTESTINAL   The patient was anemic secondary to a
peptic ulcer bleed or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug
induced gastritis   He was given   units of packed red blood
cells  and his hematocrit appropriately went from   to
   He was given Protonix   mg p o  q d  for prophylaxis 
His aspirin was withheld due to the bleed   The patient was
scoped on  

   CARDIOVASCULAR   The patient had a demand ischemia and
lateral infarct  according to cardiac enzymes changes and
electrocardiogram changes   His infarct was located
laterally  according to the ST depressions that were found in
leads I  aVL  and V  through V   These electrocardiogram
changes remained stable and unchanged throughout the hospital
course 

Over a  hour period  his creatine kinase did rise from  
peaking at   and then declining down to    His CK MB
was   on admission  peaking at   and trending down to  
His creatine kinase index was   on admission  peaking
at   and trending down to a normal value of  

His cardiologist  Dr   Last Name  STitle    did see him in house and
recommended that a beta blocker be added to his medication
regimen   Metoprolol   mg p o  b i d  was added 

With regard to coronary artery disease  the patient s aspirin
was held in light of his gastrointestinal bleed   With regard
to the hypertension  the patient s blood pressure remained
within the normal systolic range of   to   over the
hospital course 

As for his congestive heart failure  the patient remained
clinically asymptomatic and was saturating above   during
the hospital stay 

   RESPIRATORY   The patient did have a bilateral basilar
opacity on the chest x ray   However  he did not have any
respiratory problems clinically   After his transfusion of
  units of packed red blood cells  the patient was not given
any additional intravenous fluids that would exacerbate his
congestive heart failure   It was recommended that he follow
up with a chest x ray within one week 

   HEMATOLOGY   The patient s anemia resolved with a
transfusion of   units of packed red blood cells   His
hematocrit appropriately bumped from   to  

   ENDOCRINE   Since the patient was started on a clear
liquid diet  per Gastroenterology recommendations  he was
restarted on his metformin   mg p o  b i d   His medication
adequately controlled his fingerstick blood sugar levels of
below  s 

   RENAL   The patient did have a anion gap metabolic
acidosis with a transfusion and
hydration  the patient s acidosis did resolve   Also  the
hydration also helped resolve his prerenal azotemia because
his creatinine went from   back to a baseline of

Brief Hospital Course 
  yo male with COPD  Afib  HTN  who presents with dyspnea and
wheezing

  Dyspnea Wheezing  Initially presentation was most consistent
with a COPD exacerbation  There was no clear inciting event 
though most likely either from a viral URI or aspiration event 
A CXR did not show any infiltrate to suggest PNA  He was
initially placed on BiPAP given his significant wheezing 
respiratory distress  and tachypnea with improvement   He was
maintained on standing ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers
initially   The patient became quite agitated on albuterol  and
switched to xopenex with some improvement   He was also started
on methylprednisolone as well for a COPD exacerbation   He was
given a   day course of levofloxacin  His sputum culture grew
oropharyngeal flora and repiratory viral studies were all
negative  His blood urine cultures were negative as well 

Prior to discharge  he was transitioned to a prednisone taper 
he should take   mg x   days    mg x   days    mg x   days 
  mg x   days  and   mg x   days then stop   He was discharged
with a shovel face mask just for comfort  but his oxygen
saturations were   on RA 

If patient is to be on greater than or equal to   mg of
prednisone daily for greater than   month  please consider
starting PCP  Name Initial  PRE   

We again counselled the patient on smoking cessation given his
severe lung disease 

  Delerium Sundowning  The patient would have significant sun
downing and agitation around   PM every evening   He would
occasionally become agitated during the day to   Infectious
workup was otherwise negative   B Folate TSH were normal   CT
head showed evidence of old infarct  but no new bleed or infarct
 given supratherapeutic INR   He was given haldol initially for
acute agitation  then was switched to haldol   mg PO BID and  
mg PO Q H PRN agitation   The likely cause of his delerium was
in the setting of high dose steroids and ICU setting   It was
slowly improving at the time of discharge   He was able to
recite his full name  knew he was in a hospital  but was not
oriented to time 

  Atrial Fibrillation  Patient maintained as an outpatient on
digoxin and verapamil   Initially  given his inability to take
POs  he was not taking verapamil and had episodes of rapid
ventricular rates and was treated with diltiazem   mg IV PRN 
At the time of discharge  he was able to take POs  and had a
dobhoff placed  so his HR was controlled on his home verapamil
dose   He was also continued on his digoxin   His INR was
supratherapeutic on admission  and increased while on
levofloxacin   His warfarin was held  and at the time of
discharge  his INR was    His INR should be rechecked daily
until   and then his home warfarin   mg daily should be
restarted   There was no evidence of bleeding 

  Hyperlipidemia  cont simvastatin

  s p MI  Patient did not have any evidence of MI  and there
were no acute ischemic changes on his ECG on admission   He was
maintained on his home simvastatin  verapamil  imdur  and
furosemide   His furosemide was held on the day of discharge for
hypernatremia   This should be restarted on    He is not
on aspirin  and this should be readdressed with his PCP 

  Hypernatremia  Patient s Na at discharge was    This is
likely in the setting of poor PO intake and furosemide   His
furosemide was held on day of discharge and should be restarted
on    Also  his free water flushes were increased to  
mL Q H  and his Na should be rechecked daily until normalizes 

  Aspiration   patient was seen by speech and swallow  and felt
that he was not safe for full POs at this time   He was
maintained on ground diet with nectar thickened liquids   He
also had a dobhoff placed and was started on tube feeds per
nutrition recommendations   He should have a repeat swallow eval
as his mental status improves to determine his diet further

Brief Hospital Course 
  y o male with PMHx CAD who presented with chest congestion 
found to have ventricular tachycardia 

  Ventricular tachycardia   The patient had ventricular
tachycardia that was caught on EKG   The patient was started on
dofetilide and metoprolol for control of his arrythmia   He was
monitored with EKGs after his daily doses of dofetilide for the
first   days  with only a slight increase in his QT interval 
He did not have any more episodes of v tach while in the
hospital and was dischaged on dofetilide and metoprolol   An
echocardiogram was performed with no structural etiology of the
v tach noted   It was felt his arrythmia would be able to be
properly controlled with medication rather than an ablation 
 
  CAD  The patient s home medication regimen was continued 
 
  HTN  on atenolol   mg daily and lisinopril   mg daily at
home  Elevated BP in ED 
The patient s atenolol was switched to metoprolol succinate for
its rate controlling properties   He was continued on
lisinopril

Conclusions 
The left atrium is moderately dilated  The inferior vena cava is
dilated   cm  The left ventricular cavity size is normal 
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction  LV systolic function appears depressed   Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation  Tissue velocity
imaging E e  is elevated   suggesting increased left
ventricular filling pressure  PCWP mmHg  Resting regional
wall motion abnormalities include inferolateral akinesis and
inferior hypokinesis  The anterior and  anterolateral segments
were not fully visualized  Estimated left ventricular ejection
fraction   There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis  The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened 
There is mild aortic valve stenosis  Mild   aortic
regurgitation is seen  The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened  The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic
deformity  Moderate   mitral regurgitation is seen   Due to
acoustic shadowing  the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated  The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened  Moderate   tricuspid regurgitation is seen 
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension  There is
no pericardial effusion 
Compared with the prior study  images reviewed  of   the
left
ventricular function is now mildy depressed  the pulmonary
pressures are
slighly higher 
 
Cardiac catheterization 
COMMENTS 
  Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
severe native   vessel disease  The LMCA had a   distal
stenosis  The
LAD was totally occluded after a small D  The distal LAD filled
via a
patent LIMA graft  The LCX was totally occluded after a ramus 
The left
PL branch filled via collaterals from the RCA  The RCA had a  

proximal stenosis with diffuse disease throughout  FFR was
 
  Graft angiography showed a patent LIMA to LAD  The SVG to OM 
and SVG
to LPL were totally occluded proximally 
  Limited hemodynamics on entry showed severe LV systolic
dysfunction 
There was no gradient across the aortic valve on pullback 
  Left ventriculography revealed severe systolic dysfunction
with  
MR  There was global hypokinesis with severe posterobasal and
inferior
hypokinesis 
  The proximal RCA lesion was predilated with a   X  mm
Voyager
balloon and stented with a   X  mm Vision stent with lesion
reduction
from   to   The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no

dissection and no embolisation   see PTCA comments 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS 
  Severe native   vessel disease 
  Patent LIMA to LAD  Occluded SVG OM and SVG LPL 
  Severe LV diastolic and systolic dysfunction 
  Moderate to severe MR 
  Successful stenting of the proximal RCA lesion

multiple DVTs p w worsening DOE  Symptoms  labs  exam  and
imaging all c w fluid overload from CHF 
 
 Dyspnea
Unclear inciting event for pulmonary edema  most likely from
volume overload  vs  ischemia given bump in CEs from prior
visit  However  it is difficult to interpret these enzymes in
the setting of the pt s extreme renal failure  Pt s EKG paced 
PE was considered given the pt s apparent prothrombotic
tendencies and relative hypoxia  However  on exam there was no
evidence of RV overload  and the pt is not tachycardic  although
he is beta blocked and paced  so this might be masked  Also 
his dyspnea improved after HD  Pneumonia was entertained
initally due to a retrocardiac opacity  but without fever and
the prompt resolution with medical management and HD  this
diagnosis was exceedingly unlikely  Also  the patient did not
complain of a cough nor was one noted during his hospital
course 
The patient was managed with HD  nitrates  ASA  beta blockade 
heparin  initially until the diagnosis of ischemia became less
likely and the patient was catheterized  The cath showed a RCA
lesion which was stented  He had other significant flow limiting
lesions with collaterals  The patient s Troponins were elevated 
The CK and CKMB peaked and trended downward shortly after cath

Conclusions
PRE BYPASS 

  No atrial septal defect or PFO is seen by  D or color Doppler
although difficult to find IAS due to rotation of the heart from
the aortic aneurysm 

  Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal  LVEF 


  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal 

  The ascending aorta is markedly dilated The aortic arch is
markedly dilated  The descending thoracic aorta is moderately
dilated 

  The aortic valve leaflets   appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis  Moderate  
aortic regurgitation is seen 

  The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation 

  There is no pericardial effusion 

  Dr   Last Name  STitle    was notified in person of the results during the
surgery on   at  

POSTBYPASS

  Patient is on nitroglycerin infusions

  LV EF appears underfilled initially  After blood products the
LV EF looks similar to prebypass

  A tissue valve is noted in the aortic position  It is well
seated and well functioning  No perivalvular leaks noted  Peak
gradient of   mmHg and mean gradient   mmHg 

  Graft material is noted in the ascending aorta and tube graft
is seen in the descending aorta

History of Present Illness 
Pt is a   yo Vietnamese male w  a PMH sig for Non small cell
endobronchial lung CA s p RMSB stent   COPD  CRI  recent
admission for respiratory distress requiring intubation  and
chest tube placement x   in    who presented to an OSH on
      with significant tachypnea and tachycardia 
requiring   L NC to keep sats above   The patient s
respiratory status continued to decline and he was placed on
BIPAP and treated with morphine  IV Lasix  steroids 
ceftriaxone  and azithromycin  The patient s respiratory
distress did not resolve and after obtaining an ABG of
  the patient was transferred to  Hospital    for further
management 

In the ED at  Hospital    the patient s mental status declined and his
hypercarbia worsened considerably with an ABG   on
BIPAP  Shortly after the results of this blood gas were obtained
the patient was intubated  He became hypotensive with SBP 
post intubation  He was given  cc of fluid and started on
Levophed after a central line was placed in his right femoral
vein  His BP subsequently improved to MAP  The patient was
further resuscitated with   L of IVF in the ED before being
transferred to the MICU for further medical management

Pertinent Results 
ECHO Study Date of  
Conclusions 
 Technically difficult study 
  The left atrium is normal in size 
 Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal  The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal  Due to suboptimal technical quality  a focal
wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded  Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is low normal  LVEF  
 Right ventricular chamber size is normal  Right ventricular
systolic
function is borderline normal 
 The aortic valve leaflets   appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation   The mitral valve
leaflets are
structurally normal  No mitral regurgitation is seen 
 There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad  though a
loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded 
There is no
evidence of RV compression 

CXR  
Compared to the prior film of   the patient has
been extubated and the lines have been removed  Heart size is
normal  Extensive scarring is present in both upper lobes with
upward retraction of both hila  Pleural thickening is present
over the right lung apex and there is shift of the trachea to
the right  All of these findings are unchanged since the prior
film of   Similarly  the tenting of both
hemidiaphragms and pleural thickening in the right costophrenic
angle are unchanged  No pneumothorax and no new lung lesions

Brief Hospital Course 
  Respiratory distress  The patient s respiratory status was
complicated by a number of factors including his underlying
COPD  diastolic heart failure  lung Ca  and suspected infection 
The patient has significant CO  retention at baseline with PaCO 
  and a baseline compensatory metabolic alkalosis with HCO 
in the low  s  The patient was initially intubated in the
setting of hypercarbia and impending respiratory failure  He was
started on standing albuterol atrovent MDI s as well as stress
dose steroids  On   he underwent flexible bronchoscopy with
BAL at the bedside which demonstrated significant airway edema 
thick white secretions but no obstruction  The patient s RMS
stent was patent  The BAL fluid was positive for RSV antigen but
no virus was isolated  The Gram stain  fungal  AFB  and
Legionella cultures were all negative  Due to the patient s poor
airway compliance  significant bronchospasm  and anxiety  he
developed autopeep on the ventilator calculated to be   This
degree of autopeep made it almost impossible for him to trigger
the ventilator on pressure support  Therefore  the patient s
sedation was increased using both fentanyl and propofol in order
to decrease the respiratory rate while still on AC and decrease
his autopeep  Once the patient s autopeep was down to   he was
started on PS   The following day he was able to tolerate PS
of   and eventually weaned to   He was successfully
extubated on   He remained stable from a respiratory
standpoint following extubation  initially requiring a face
mask  then oxygen via nasal cannula   He continue to improve
with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers and was breathing
progressively more comfortably over the next few days on the
floor with no significant oxygen need 

  question of PNA  Patient s underlying respiratory distress
thought secondary to underlying  sepsis   PNA aspiration vs 
MSSA PNA  The patient was placed on Vanc Levo Flagyl for empiric
coverage of GP GN anerobes  He was febrile on admission  but
afebrile throughout remainder of ICU stay  Blood cx drawn on
admission and on follow up were negative  Of note  RSV antigen
was detected in his sputum  The patient s antibiotics were
continued until extubation and then discontinued   Pt continued
to improve and follow up chest X ray showed on   showed no
new lung lesions   Pt was maintained off antibiotics and did not
worsen from a respiratory standpoint 

  Sepsis  Hypotension likely related to septic shock on
admission  Patient initially received   L of IVF in the ED and  
L of IVF after arrival to the MICU  He initially required
pressure support with Levophed  but this was weaned off within
the first   hours  An ECHO was performed which showed no
evidence of pericardial effusion  a normal LA  and an EF of
  He was bolused for low CVP throughout the first several
days of his hospital stay such that by   the patient was
over   L positive  but did not show any signs of peripheral
edema  The patient was thought to be profoundly intravascularly
depleted   sepsis  poor nutritional status and poor PO intake 
He was given Lasix  mg IV x   on   and subsequent
auto diuresis with additional medication  Although he was
initially hypotensive  the patient s HR and BP slowly increased
such that his HR was in the  s with SBP  He was started on
diltiazem which was quickly titrated to  mg qid for heart rate
control   As he improved clinically  the diltiazem was decreased
and pt was sent home on  mg po qid   Pt was somewhat
tachycardic to  s on the floor  but this seemed to be more in
the immediate post albuterol nebulizer setting  as well as due
to dehydration  as below   Pulse taken spaced out from nebs was
more in the  s s 

  COPD  Severe underlying disease possible exacerbation in the
setting of RSV bronchiolitis complicated the patient s
respiratory status  He was maintained on standing
albuterol atrovent treatments and given IV steroids that were
changed to PO prednisone after extubation  The patient was
maintained on a slow prednisone taper due to his severe disease 
and was also sent home with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers 

  acute renal failure  The patient s Cr on presentation was
  This improved over the course of his hospital stay to his
baseline Cr of   which remained stable over the rest of his
hospitalization 

  non small cell Lung CA  The patient s oncologist was made
aware of his admission to the hospital  She met with the family
and confirmed the patient s code status as full   Prior to
admission the patient had received carboplatin treatment 

  Thrombocytopenia  On admission  the patient s platelets were
  They declined slowly to a nadir of   The patient had no
signs of bleeding  Thrombocytopenia was felt most likely
secondary to medication administration  likely secondary to
Carboplatin  which he received prior to admission  there was
also concern over contribution from vancomycin or levaquin 
which were discontinued  An HIT antibody was sent which was
negative   Pt s platelets remained stable over the course of the
rest of his stay and had even begun to recover  reaching   on
the day of discharge   This favors the possibility of a
drug induced effect  most likely bone marrow suppression due to
carboplatin 

   Cachexia malnutrition   Pt had poor po intake after he was
extubated and began to recover   His mental status improved  but
he became transiently hypernatremic and required free water
repletion   He was started on Megace  and uptitrated to  mg
daily  which he said resulted in improved appetite   However  he
was still with poor po intake on discharge  which is thought to
be due to his malignancy   He was sent out on amitriptyline 
which is covered by free care   During the hospitalization  and
likely due to poor po intake  pt was dehydrated  with
hypernatremia  relative hypotension to SBP  s  tachycardia to
 s  and a contraction alkalosis   This improved with IV
hydration but will likely continue to be problem Name  NI   

   Hyperglycemia   Pt s glucose was often in the  s   The
reasons were thought to be multifactorial  most notably in the
setting of infection and then with steroids   He was covered on
an insulin sliding scale   However  due to the fact that the
steroids will be tapered over the next   weeks  patient was
not given any antihyperglycemic agents for home use   He should
have his glucose rechecked by his new primary care physician 

   Mental status  Pt required haldol and increased sedation
while in the ICU  even needing a sitter temporarily   After
extubation  his mental status improved  though he was markedly
confused over the first   days   A depression screen revealed
no evidence of depression  and pt was back to his baseline per
family members

He states that he feels less able to transfer back and forth to
his wheelchair to make his usual trips to  Company   He also
notes nausea and nonbloody vomitting after every meal over this
same time period  He denies abdominal pain or diarrhea  He
further denies shortness of breath  He denies fevers or cough 
He further denies chest pain  palpitations  abdominal pain 
urinary pain
In the ED  VS were initially    BP   HR   RR   O 
  on NRB  falling to mid s on RA  On lung exam  he had
diffuse rales and rhonchi  CXR showed posible LLL infiltrate 
Labs notable for creatinine elevated to   and potassium of
  ABG   He was given   mg IV levofloxacin   
mg IV methylprednisone  and   round of albuterol ipratropium
nebulizers  He was also given   units insulin and   amp D  for
the hyperkalemia as well as Zofran   mg IV and Tetanus
vaccination  EKG was similar to baseline  NIPPV was tried for
comfort  but patient did not cooperate with it  Thus  the
patient was changed to nonrebreather

Brief Hospital Course 
Mr Known lastname   is a   year old gentleman w  DM  who presented w 
malaise and hypoxia 

  Hypoxia  hypercarbia  Initial ABG   on
nonrebreather   Patient was immediately weaned to  L NC in the
MICU with O  Sats    Although mental status was initially
excellent  after   hours in MICU patient suddenly became
obtunded and was not arousable to sternal rub   O  Sats remained
   ABG showed    Actue hypercarbia was likely
secondary to a combination of baseline COPD and severe upper
airway obstruction in the setting of a large tongue and oral
soft tissues as well as poor posture   Patient likely
additionally has both obstructive sleep apnea and or
obesity hypoventilation syndrome   BiPap was used intermittently
with improvement in mental status and ventilation   On transfer
to the floor  pt was satting in mid  s on room air and using
BiPAP at night  Mr   Known lastname   was treated empirically for COPD
exacerbation including standing nebulizers  azithromycin for a
 day course  and prednisone   mg taper   Sleep consult was
obtained to organize home nocturnal CPAP vs bipap  Prior to
discharge  follow up was made with pulmonary  Dr   Last Name  STitle   
pulmonary function lab for PFTs and sleep  Last Name  STitle    for
outpatient sleep studies  He will have home BiPAP arranged by
sleep clinic 

  Nausea and vomitting  This may have been secondary to viral
illness or generalized malaise secondary to intermittent
hypercarbia at home  None since arrival  UA was not consistent
with a urinary tract infection as the etiology 

  Acute on chronic renal insufficiency  Creatinine   on
admission  from   when last checked   months ago  Creatinine
rose after  L fluid challenge   Urine lytes were not consistent
with pre renal etiology   This was thought to be most likely
secondary to ATN in the setting of hypoension at home from
nausea and vomitting   He continued to make   cc h urine 
Renal ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of hydronephrosis 
Creatinine continued to improve during hospital course as it
dropped to   the day before discharge 

  Chronic pain  Methadone and gabapentin were recently
increased by pt s PCP    Name   NameIs    were held in the setting of
altered mental status as well as acute renal failure initially 
On transfer to general medical wards  pain medication was
restarted as creatinine improved from   on admission to  
Pt was restarted on outpatient regimen of  mg 

  Poor self care   Patient reported that his girlfriend  
visiting nurse take care of him   However  on admission he
smelled bad and was covered in several layers of dirt  He also
had multiple cigarette burns and cuts on his arms  likely
indicative of attempts at self harm   He denied suicidality on
admisison   He is likely depressed and he will need psychiatric
follow up 

  Type II Diabetes Mellitus  Novolin and humalog SS were
continued per home regimen  He was discharged on home dose of
    units in the AM and   in PM   He has close PCP follow
up on   and will have Electrolytes  BUN and Cr labs
drawn by VNA on   and these will be faxed to his PCP s
office 

On admission  patient stated his desire to be DNR DNI   He
further ellaborated that he would want no invasive lines or
procedures including arterial lines or central venous lines 
This was documented in the ICU consent in his chart

Evaluation of the
vasculature requested 

TECHNIQUE  Multiplanar T  T  and susceptibility images of the
brain were
obtained  No contrast was administered  MR angiography of the
circle of  Location  un    was performed with acquisition of two  and
three  dimensional time of flight images  MR angiography of the
neck was also performed with two  and three dimensional
time  of  flight images of the major arteries 

FINDINGS  On the brain images  there is no evidence of
hydrocephalus  mass
effect  or shift of the normally midline structures  The
ventricles 
cisterns  and sulci are unremarkable  There are patchy areas of
increased T 
signal in the pons  There are also widespread patchy areas of
increased T 
signal in the subcortical white matter of both cerebral
hemispheres  These
signal abnormalities are consistent with chronic small vessel
ischemic
infarcts  Also  in the posterosuperior right frontal cortex 
there is a small
area of increased T  signal in the cortex consistent with a
chronic
infarction  A similar small infarct in the head of the left
caudate nucleus
is also observed  No susceptibility artifact is seen  The
visualized
vascular flow voids are present  The osseous structures  soft
tissues  and
sinuses are unremarkable  MR angiography of the circle of  Location  un   
shows no evidence of stenosis in the major vessels  Along the
proximal right posterior cerebral artery  there is a tiny focus
of increased signal intensity on the two dimensional
time of flight images  In the source images  there is no
suggestion of an aneurysm at that site  This small focus appears
to be an artifact  There is no definite
evidence of an aneurysm  MR angiography of the carotid and
vertebral arteries in the neck is significant for a severe
stenosis beyond the bifurcation in the left proximal internal
carotid artery  Only mild carotid narrowing is seen at the left
carotid bifurcation  The left carotid bifurcation is more
superiorly located
than the right  and accordingly  three dimensional time 
of flight images
understandably did not entirely cover this area  The severe left
proximal
internal carotid stenosis is best visualized on the
two dimensional time  of 
flight images  On the right side  on both the two  and
three dimensional
time of  flight images  a probable moderate to severe right
carotid stenosis
at the bifurcation  and moderate to severe right proximal
internal carotid
stenosis is also seen 

IMPRESSION  The head MRI shows evidence of widespread patchy
increased T 
signal  These are are consistent with chronic small vessel
ischemic infarcts  The MR angiogram of the circle of  Location  un   
shows no definite evidence of stenosis or aneurysm  The MR
angiogram of the neck is significant for a severe left internal
carotid artery stenosis beyond the bifurcation  with mild
stenosis at the bifurcation  On the right  there is evidence of
moderate to severe stenosis at the
bifurcation and in the proximal internal carotid artery

Procedure Date 


Brief Hospital Course 
Admitted for stent placement in the left ICA  Pt  returned from
cath with   mcg kg min of phenylephrine  successfully weaned 
Pt  experienced brief bouts of non specific bilateral radiating
numbness but with consistently normal CNII XII exam  likely
transient vagal depression nature  The patient also has a
biventricular ICD implanted  which was interrogated prior to the
stent procedure  It was determined that the RV lead ICD had
become dislodged  The defibrillator function was disabled 
leaving the device operating as an RA LV DDD pacer  CXR
indicated that the RV lead had ascended into the RA  The pacer
function began to be impaired by erroneous sensing  with pacing
occuring on the ST segment leading to brief aberrant NSVT runs 
EP put the ICD into  Last Name  un     sense only  mode  and the patients
leads were then percutaneously resited satisfactorily as
confirmed by repeat CXR  ICD function was tested and found to be
satisfactory  The patient did well after carotid stenting and
ICD lead revision and was subsequently discharged home with
assistance in stable and improved condition

 M with hx of prostate CA  CAD s p BMS x  in   chronic
systolic CHF here with two days of BRBPR that was admitted with
a large acute LGIB thought to be diverticular in etiology 
Hospital course notable for   ICU stays 
 
ACUTE ISSUES 
  Diverticular LGIB   Pt was admitted with LGIB  On day   while
being prepped for colonoscopy the pt had an acute GIB and was
brought to the unit  The situation was discussed with his
outpatient cardiologist  Dr   Last Name  STitle    who recommended
discontinuing plavix but continuing aspirin   He was re started
on aspirin   mg day but this was stopped again when he
re bled   As above  ultimately  the source was found to be a
solitary cecal bleed found by a tagged RBC scan   He was treated
with blood transfusions  and ultimately IR deployed   coils to a
branch of the ileocolic artery   His bleeding stopped after this
procedure  but upon tranfer to the general medicine service on
the evening of   he again began to have hematochezia  He
underwent a CTA on   that showed no evidence of
extravasation  He was transferred back to the ICU  where Hcts
were stable   Follow up colonoscopy to assess for source of
persistent bleeding was was planned for   Colonoscopy did
not show any active bleeding or any source of bleeding but
revealed diffuse diverticulosis L R  At time of transfer to
floor  the pt had received a total of  U PRBC  last    U
platelets  and   U FFP  He was on a protonix drip which was
transitioned to  mg IV daily  The patient was discharged on
  on ASA  mg  plavix was held after discussing this with his
outpatient cardiologist Dr   Last Name  STitle    via email 
 
  CAD  s p two DES in   Plavix was discontinued 
aspirin was continued  then stopped when he re bled  After IR
embolization procedure  pt was tachycardic and hypertensive for
a brief period of time  EKG was performed with ST depressions in
V  which was felt to be demand ischemia in the setting of low
HCT  trop       He was transfused again to a goal
of    in the setting of possible ischemia  with resolution
of his EKG findings  Follow up EKG showed stable TWI in III 
aVF  V V  no ST segment elevation  cardiac enzymes  CK MG
negative x  trop   x  Pt denied chest pain on day of
discharge from  Hospital Unit Name   His ASA was discontinued in the  Hospital Unit Name   given
that the patient re bled  His Plavix continues to be held  His
home statin was resumed on day of discharge from  Hospital Unit Name   The pt
did not have CP throughout his admission 
 
  Chronic Systolic CHF  EF   Pt was euvolemic on admission 
His antihypertensives  beta blockers   Last Name  un    were both held early
on during his admission given his hypotension in the setting of
bleeding   He was started back on half his home lopressor after
successful IR intervention  and was restarted on his home
carvedilol at half dose upon transfer to the floor  When he
began bleeding again and was transferred back to the ICU  his
Metoprolol was held and his Carvedilol was continued  BPs ran
high in the ICU in the setting of holding metoprolol

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE   The patient is admitted to Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further observation of respiratory
distress   On hospital day   the patient underwent
bronchoscopy which revealed multiple hemorrhagic metastases
extending through the large portion of the bronchial tree 

At this point  a discussion with the family was initiated with
the presence of medical oncology  interventional pulmonology and
critical care   As there were no more therapeutic options
available from an oncologic or airway standpoint  all were in
agreement that it would be in the best interest for
the patient to pursue a nonaggressive approach   Therefore 
the patient was made comfort measures only  and was started
on a Morphine drip   He expired the same day in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit

Brief Hospital Course 
A P   M with AIDS  VL K and CD  complicated by
multiple opportunistic infections transferred from MICU  Patient
has a history of MAC  PCP   Name   NameIs    gastritis colitis  and  Female First Name  un   
esophagitis  He reported having diarrhea prior to admission  He
was found to have a hct of   on arrival 
 
  SOB 
The patient has been admitted and seen by a doctor multiple
times in the past year for increasing SOB  It is unclear what
the true etiology is but is likely multifactorial given his
history of COPD emphysema by previous CTA  as well as   AFB in
sputum in   which grew MAC  His initial CT was negative for
PE but showed a lingular infiltrate as well which was concern
for pneumonia  Patient was placed on ceftriaxone and
clarithromycin for a possible CAP or MAC  He was subsequently
switched to azithromycin and discharged on PO augmentin to
complete a  day course of abx  He received alb ipratroprium
nebs and salmeterol INH  ID continued to follow until patient
was discharged  A repeat CXR showed left basilar
atelectasis scarring with no pleural effusion  Patient s room
air oxygen saturation was   on discharge 
 
  SSCP 
This issue seems to be chronic for the patient although he
reports that the pain has been worse lately  It is the same type
of pain he usually experiences at home  The pain seems to
migrate throughout his upper body  chest and abdomen  from one
day to another  The pain did not radiate anywhere and was not
associated with diaphoresis  or changes in RR  HR  or BP  It was
occasionally associated with movement or coughing  We thought
the etiology was likely musculoskeletal  However  given its
substernal nature  the patient was worked up for possible
cardiopulmonary causes 
EKG unchanged from prior  CTA negative for PE  and cardiac
enzymes on admission were negative  A thoracic lumbar spine film
showed thoracic spondylosis without listhesis or fracture with
an unremarkable lumbar spine  The patient s pain was controlled
with percocet which helped alleviate it 
 
  ANEMIA 
The patient s hematocrit was   on admission   His anemia was
consistent with anemia of chronic disease with possible
underlying iron deficiency anemia  Iron studies were  fe  
calc TIBC   folate   nl  hapto   nl  ferritin   TRF
  He had a bone marrow biospsy in   which was
negative negative for malignancy  infection or infiltrative
process  He received pRBCs throughout his stay for a goal hct
  He was discharged with a hematocrit of   He also received
vitamin B  thiamine  and folate during his stay  Smear on
admission showed schistocytes raising concern for intravascular
hemolysis but tbili was low
 
  AIDS 
The patient has advanced HIV AIDS  He was continued on his
outpatient HAART regimen  He continued to receive the following
prophylactic meds  azithromycin  Bactrim DS  Diflucan  nystatin
s sw  and Acyclovir  which was later switched to
valganciclovir  Infectious Disease continued to follow
throughout the hospitalization  He continued to receive
megestrol for AIDS anorexia
 
  DIARRHEA 
The patient s diarrhea was thought to be due to  Month  only    colitis
during a previous admission  His  Month  only    viral load was   so this
bout of diarrhea was likely due to  Month  only    colitis as well  He did
not experience diarrhea since admission and had   instances of
formed stool prior to discharge  An email was sent to his PCP
asking him to repeat the patient s  Month  only    viral load as an
outpatient  He was discharged on lifelong prophylactic
valganciclovir 
 
  ZOSTER 
This is a chronic issue for this patient who has had multiple
bouts w  zoster infection on his right buttock  This was likely
another outbreak  He was initially treated with acyclovir and
subsequently switched to valganciclovir  ID continued to follow 
The lesion was almost completely resolved prior to discharge 
 
  DYSTHYMIA 
Patient was kept on his home dose of mirtazapine and clonazepam 

 
  FEN 
Patient was maintained on a regular diet which he tolerated
well  His electrolytes were monitored daily and replenished as
needed
 
  PPX  hep SC  ranitidine QHS  fluconazole  nystatin
Other than his HIV AIDS related prophylactic meds  patient was
on SC heparin during his stay
 
  CODE 
Patient remained a full code throughout his hospitalization
 
  DISPO 
The patient was discharged home with services  He was in stable
condition  His SOB had improved and his O  sat was   on room
air  His diarrhea had resolved and his hematocrit on discharge
was

cytomegalovirus infection 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS    Known firstname    Known lastname   is a
 year old Caucasian female who underwent cadaveric renal
transplant on  

Her post transplant course has been complicated by the
development of leukopenia  presumably secondary to Valcyte
which has prompted preliminary discontinuation of the
medication   At the time of her transplant  the recipient and
donor were both cytomegalovirus positive 

For the past approximately one week  she has noticed
worsening nausea which appears to be a postprandial nature 
as well as watery diarrhea  although not increased in
frequency   She notes that all of her bowel movements are
brown watery diarrhea   She denies fevers  chills  and
vomiting 

Her laboratory studies were obtained on   which
demonstrated a hemoglobin of   and hematocrit of  
White blood cell count was   and platelet count was  
She returned to the office today for a routine visit  and
repeat laboratory studies were obtained which demonstrated a
drop in her hemoglobin of   and hematocrit of    White
blood cell count was    The platelets were pending at the
time of this dictation 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION   On examination  her
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally   Her abdomen was
soft  nontender  and nondistended   The incision had healed
nicely    There was no evidence of ventral hernias or wound
breakdown   She had no tubes or drains in place   Her abdomen
revealed no hepatosplenomegaly and no tenderness   There was
no peripheral edema   She had no asterixis   Neurologically 
she was alert and oriented times four   Cranial nerves II
through XII were intact   No focal abnormalities were
appreciated 

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE    Her most recent medications
included

IMPRESSION   Ms   Known lastname   is a  year old white female who is
approximately three months out from a cadaveric renal
transplant for sclerosing cholangitis who presented with
acute anemia  leukopenia  diarrhea  and nausea   This
constellation of symptoms was consistent with acute
cytomegalovirus infection 

PLAN    At this point in time she will be admitted to the
hospital and receive a blood transfusion   Cytomegalovirus
cultures will be obtained  and she will be started
ganciclovir empirically   A Gastroenterology consultation
will be obtained for endoscopy to rule out active hemorrhage
from either possibly a cytomegalovirus ulcer disease as well

Brief Hospital Course 
  yo M w hx of HTN who presents with hypertensive urgency 
 
  Hypertensive Urgency  No signs of end organ dysfunction based
on head CT  CXR  ECG or lab tests as above  He was placed
initially on a nitroprusside drip to to control BPs with
resulting SBPs in the  s  He was then transitioned to his home
BP meds  although chlorthalidone was increased to   mg as   mg
not available on formulary  BPs remained elevated to SBPs  s 
The patient has been non compliant with medications and likely
has essential hypertension which is difficult to control   UA
shows proteinuria  which may be a sign of chronic end organ
damage  However  given his young age and markedly elevated blood
pressure  further evaluation for secondary causes of
hypertension was initiated  Renal ultrasound was ordered  which
he will obtain as an outpatient  Close outpatient follow up
arranged this week and plan for further evaluation communicated
with PCP 
 
  Medication Non compliance  Due to side effects per patient 
The morning after admission  patient also expressed desire to
leave hospital  stating that he  just didn t want to be in the
hospital  The situation was discussed with Spanish interpreter 
and risks of leaving AMA with persistently elevated pressures
were explained  Patient agreed to stay

Abdominal pain  nausea and vomiting 

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure

History of Present Illness 
Pt is a  yo Spanish speaking woman with poorly differentiated
stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma  who presents with abdominal
distension as well as recurrent epigastric abdominal pain 
nausea  and vomiting  after a recent admission for similar
symptoms  She was recently admitted with epigastric abdominal
pain  bloating  nausea  and vomiting  which were thought to be
related to her malignancy and possible intermittent SBO  She had
not been taking her PPI at home  Symptoms improved in hospital
and she was able to tolerate a solid diet  She was discharged on
a regimen of Maalox and PPI  She had been evaluated by surgery 
who felt that she was not a surgical candidate  Since discharge 
however  she has continued to feel poorly  particularly with
epigastric abdominal swelling and pain  She describes her
epigastric abdominal pain this time as different from that on
her prior hospitalization  Her pain is severe across the upper
abdomen including both upper quadrants  with radiation to the
upper back bilaterally  Today her pain became more severe  with
associated nausea and non bloody bilious emesis  as well as
progressive weakness and dehydration  She also developed
headache and diarrhea  but denies any hematemesis  melena  or
hematochezia  She has been compliant with her medications since
discharge  She denies any fevers  chills  or other associated
symptoms

Past Medical History 
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY   Had several years of abdominal
complaints and was under the care of Dr   Last Name  STitle    at  Hospital     In   she underwent EGDs   It appears that
the first was nondiagnostic and on the second  
biopsy of a large  fungating  ulcerated mass in the gastric body
which precluded advancing the endoscope   On   she
underwent a CT which showed an infiltrating tumor of the gastric
body and antrum with peritoneal  omental and mesenteric
metastatic disease  note was made of soft tissue near the
terminal ileum   The pathology showed poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma with signet ring features staining positive with
cytokeratin AE  there was extensive granulation and
ulceration   Per report CEA and CA   were not elevated   She
required admission from   to   for N V  epigastric
pain radiating to the back and down flanks and inability to
tolerate PO  a port o cath was placed   A total weight loss of
  lbs compared to   was noted   She established care at
 First Name   NamePattern     Last Name  NamePattern    for Hematology and Medical Oncology of  Hospital    and
was started on FOLFOX on   for metastatic gastric cancer to
the peritoneum   Cycle   of FOLFOX was complicated by coffee
ground emesis for which she was admitted from   to  
during which time she received supportive care     a
repeat CT scan showed persistent gastric wall thickening with
peritoneal carcinomatosis and a left adnexal complex lesion 
mostly cystic which was enlarged from prior study   Her weight
improved and there was no further bleeding   In all  she
received   cycles of FOLFOX and was then started on maintenance
Capecitabine on    A CT   showed stable stomach
wall thickening  omental thickening and nodularity  interval
growth of a right adnexal lesion  predominantly cystic and a
left adnexal lesion decreased in size

IMAGING 
  KUB  IMPRESSION   There is slight prominence of loops of
bowel in the left upper quadrant with multiple air fluid levels
noted elsewhere   As a result  these findings may be
representative of obstruction versus ileus   Clinical
correlation is recommended 
 
  CT ABD PELVIS  IMPRESSION 
   No obstruction 
   Soft tissue lesion within the antrum of the stomach 
possibly extending into the duodenal bulb  is consistent with
known gastric adenocarcinoma 
   Moderate amount of intermediate dense fluid within the
abdomen and pelvis   Slightly hyperenhancement of the peritoneum
is concerning for an underlying infectious inflammatory process 
   Soft tissue enhancing lesion within the right adnexa is
concerning for metastatic disease   Further investigation with
targeted ultrasound can be performed if clinically indicated 
 
  CT ABD PELVIS  IMPRESSION 
   Redemonstration of gastric mass compatible with
adenocarcinoma and moderate ascites with peritoneal enhancement 
likely reflecting peritoneal carcinomatosis 
   No evidence of bowel obstruction 
   Bilateral adnexal lesions  with a solid mass in the right
adnexa
concerning for metastasis  and a complex left ovarian cystic
lesion  Findings can be better assessed with ultrasound 
   Possible area of abnormal enhancement within the region of
the terminal ileum  which is stable from the prior study  and
may represent a neoplastic  inflammatory  or infectious process 
Appendix not well seen  Findings may be better assessed with a
dedicated CT enterography exam with oral contrast 
 
  CXR  An in dwelling central line catheter is in place  
the tip is not optimally visualized  but likely lies in the
region of the SVC RA junction   There are low inspiratory
volumes   Allowing for this  heart size is probably borderline 
but not frankly enlarged   Minimal patchy opacity at the right
base is noted   This likely represents atelectasis  rather than
a focus of aspiration  but attention to this area on followup
films could help to better characterize this   Lungs are
otherwise grossly clear  without CHF  focal infiltrate  or
effusion

Discharge Instructions 
You were admitted to the hospital for nausea  vomiting  and
abdominal pain   CT of the abdomen did not show a blockage  but
did show extensive metastatic stomach cancer  which is likely
the cause of your symptoms   Paracentesis  drainage of fluid
from the abdominal cavity  was done and although no bacteria
grew in culture  the white blood cells in the fluid could
reflect an infection   Therefore  you were treated with
antibiotics and will need to complete a course at home   If the
nausea and vomiting recur  you may need a feeding tube placed 
You were also started on a medication to improve intestinal

Brief Hospital Course 
  Gram negative rod bacteremia from urosepsis   The patient was
treated with a   day course of ciprofloxacin with good result 
Surveillance cultures were all negative 
 
  Renal failure  Likely due to prerenal azotemia  He had a
renal ultrasound which demonstrated increased resistive indices 
however  it was not thought his renal insufficiency was from
rejection  The patient was hydrated and given blood transfusions
and he had an improvement in his creatinine  He was maintained
on his home immunosuppression of Imuran  prednisone and
Rapamune  The patient had elevated rapamune levels related to
his concurrent antibiotic use  He required decreased rapamune
dosing during his period of antibiotic treatment  His labs will
be closely followed as an outpatient and his dose adjusted as
necessary 
 
  Type I diabetes  the patient presented in DKA and was well
controlled on an insulin drip  He was converted back to his home
regimen of   units every morning and sliding scale 
 
  Anion gap metabolic acidosis  due to dka and uremia   In
addition to treating the underlying precipitants  he was given
bicarbonate replacement for a short time 
 
  Anemia  the patient was transferred to the floor after having
a   point hematocrit drop over a period of   days  His initial
hematocrit was likely dry  Repeat of his   value was    The
patient received   units blood transfusion without complication 

 
  Access  Had a femoral line during ICU stay which
intermittently had difficulty drawing back   Ultimately a
bedside PICC was placed which required IR revision   Access is
very difficult in this patient 
 
  Disposition  he was discharged home with close follow up 
PICC removed

Brief Hospital Course 
Ms   Known lastname   is a  yo female with CAD and PVD with multiple
coronary and peripheral artery stents and recent left lobectomy
for lung cancer complicated by atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
now presenting with LGIB 

  LGIB   Upon admission  patient was given  U PRBC and was
closely monitored on the wards  when she was noted to have a
large bloody bowel movement accompanied by onset of Afib with
RVR and hypotension  Patient was bolused with  ml of NS and
transfered to the MICU for further management   In the MICU 
patient continued to pass BRBPR and received an additional  
units of PRBC  INR was measured at   ASA and coumadin were
discontinued  while plavix was continued  Colonoscopy was
performed on   showing old and new blood throughout the
colon  with more active bleeding present in the descending colon
when compared to ascending colon  Moderate to severe
diverticulosis was also noted  Per GI recs  tagged red blood
cell scan was performed on   and showed no evidence of GI
bleed  By   the patient had received a total of   units of
blood and was no longer passing BRBPR  though she continued to
pass clots  Hct stabilized in the upper  s and INR was  
After transfer to the general medical service on   patient
continued to pass clots  but her hct remained stable in the
  range  Towards the end of her stay   plavix was
discontinued and she was started on ASA  mg   Given history of
diverticular disease   and severe diverticulosis observed
on colonoscopy  this episode of LGIB is most consistent with
diverticular bleeding   She will follow up with her cardiologist
next week to discuss reinitiation of plavix and coumadin 
 
  Atrial fibrillation  Patient had an episode of atrial
fibrillation on initial presentation associated with
hypotension  resulting in MICU transfer  She converted to sinus
and remained there while in the MICU  Patient was transferred to
the general medical service where she was monitored on telemetry
and had a recurrence of atrial fibrillation with RVR to the
 s  though mostly resting in the low  s  She remained
hemodynamically stable with palpitations as her only symptom 
She spontaneously converted to sinus with a rate in the  s the
following morning  She remained in sinus rhythm for the rest of
her hospital stay  Per recommendations of her outpatient
cardiologist Dr   Last Name  STitle    she was continued on her home dose of
amiodarone  Her coumadin was discontinued in the setting of her
GI bleed  Oral metoprolol was restarted at increased dose of
 mg tid 
 
  CAD  Patient remained chest pain free during her
hospitalization  Cardiology was contact Name  NI    on admission to
discuss risks of being on ASA and Plavix  Given significant
cardiac history  they recommneded that she be continued on both 
Nitrate and beta blocker were initially held in the setting of
GI bleed  In the latter part of her hospitalization given that
she was still having small amount of bleeding even on plavix
alone  Dr   Last Name  STitle    was contact Name  NI    and he recommended
discontinuing the plavix given that her last bare metal stent
was placed in    renal artery stent  and her last
drug eluting stent was placed in   She was instead put on
ASA  mg daily   As above  her metoprolol was restarted at a
higher dose given her a  fib with RVR   She was  however 
normotensive at time of discharge so her imdur was held pending
follow up and repeat blood pressure check this upcoming week 
 
  PVD  Patient has several stents to renal and carotid arteries 
As above  her plavix was ultimately held and ASA was continued
at  mg daily   This will be addressed further upon outpatient
follow up with her PCP and cardiologist 
 
  CRI  Creatinine remained within her baseline throughout this
admission 
 
  Lung cancer  s p lobectomy  Her respiratory status remained
stable during her hospital stay   She has outpatient follow up
appointments scheduled with her oncologists next week 
 
  PMR  Patient on Prednisone  mg as outpatient  she was
continued on this dose during her hospitalization 
 
  ACCESS  due to poor peripheral access  PICC line was placed
prior to transfer to the floor  This was removed prior to
discharge

Discharge Instructions 
You were admitted to the hospital for lower gastrointestinal
bleeding  that is most likely due to diverticulosis  While you
were in the hospital  you went into atrial fibrillation and your
blood pressure decreased  You were sent to the intensive care
unit to manage your blood pressure and were transfused with  
units of blood  Your home medications  aspirin and coumadin 
were stopped while you were in the hospital in order to help
control the bleeding  You underwent a colonoscopy which showed
blood and diverticula in your colon  A tagged red blood cell
scan to localize the source of bleeding was then done  and did
not show any active bleeding  After leaving the ICU  you were
transfered to the general medical floor where your heart rate 
rhythm  and blood pressure were monitored  You experienced
another episode of atrial fibrillation which resolved on its own
overnight  You were discharged when these became stable and you
were no longer bleeding 

While you were in the hospital we stopped your plavix and
coumadin  and changed your dose of aspirin from  mg to  mg 
When you go home please continue the aspirin  mg but do NOT
restart the plavix or coumadin until following up with Dr 
 Last Name  STitle    We also increased your dose of metoprolol from   mg

count  with fevers and with chills  her presentation was
consistent with cholangitis and pancreatitis secondary to
gallstones 

HOSPITAL COURSE      Gastrointestinal cholangeitis and
pancreatitis presumed secondary to gallstones   The patient was
made NPO  and broad spectrum antibiotics were started for
coverage   Antibiotics were Levaquin and Flagyl IV   The patient
had an ERCP done which showed    pus discharge from the major
papilla    biliary dilatation    cystic duct did not fill with
contrast    amorphous material seen in the bile duct consistent
with sludge    no filling defects to suggest stone present in
the bile duct    successful sphincterotomy  and   successful
sludge extraction 

The Gastrointestinal recommendations were that the patient be
kept NPO  and broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin 
Levofloxacin  and Flagyl   In addition  because the cystic duct
was unable to fill with contrast  there was concern over the fact
that a stone may be located in the cystic duct   General Surgery
consult was placed for evaluation for cholecystectomy 

General Surgery evaluated the patient and felt that with numerous
gallstones  with right upper quadrant and epigastric pain  fever 
increased bilirubin LFTs  that she had gallstone pancreatitis 
cholangitis  and occluded cystic duct   The Surgery Team was
concerned about elevated troponin of     Surgery was very
hesitant to operate on this patient   They felt that she was
not an operative candidate in this setting and recommended
insertion of cholecystostomy tube 

Interventional Radiology General Radiology was then consulted
for percutaneous drainage with a cholecystostomy tube   The
patient was transferred to the SICU to have the percutaneous
drains placed in that setting   The patient was then transferred
to the SICU  and a percutaneous cystostomy tube was placed
without event   The patient was then transferred back to the
floor the following day 

Regarding the patient s bile fluid  the bile fluid culture grew
out enterococcus which is resistant to Vancomycin  penicillin 
Levofloxacin  and Ampicillin   Regarding the patient s laboratory
data  after the percutaneous drainage  the patient s liver
enzymes  as well as pancreatic enzymes had been trending
downward  and on the day of discharge  the ALT is   AST
  alkaline phosphatase   amylase   total bilirubin
  and lipase  

Regarding the length of duration of the patient s biliary drain 
General Surgery recommended that the percutaneous drain stay in
place until cholecystectomy is performed  Because there was a
likelihood that the cystic duct is occluded with a stone  if the
drain is pulled prematurely  then there would be increased
pressure within the gallbladder  and the same situation scenario
would occur again   Thus  it was decided that the percutaneous
drains will remain in place until a cholecystectomy is performed 
which will be planned for approximately six months in the
future 

General Surgery typically does not operate on patients who have
had any type of coronary cardiac event until six months post
event   Given the patient s elevated troponin of   they will
plan for cholecystectomy in approximately six months  however 
prior to operation  the patient does need full cardiac work up
including a stress MIBI to identify any reversible wall motion
defects and possible coronary catheterization after the stress
MIBI to potentially stent repair any culprit lesions  This plan
has been discussed with the patient  as well as with the
patient s primary care physician   Name   NameIs    are both amenable to the
outpatient work up 

The outpatient scheduling and work up will be deferred to the
primary care physician and patient which will need to be done in
the next couple of months   Given that the patient has just had a
gastrointestinal infection and troponin leak  it is not the
appropriate time for her to proceed with cardiac work up  thus 
this will be carried out as an outpatient 

   Infectious disease   On the day of admission  the patient
was started on Levaquin  Flagyl  and Vancomycin   Subsequent
bile cultures have grown out Vancomycin resistant enterococcus 
At the time of discharge  her blood cultures are still pending  A
sputum culture was contaminated   Urine culture showed no growth 
An addendum will be made to the Infectious Disease section
regarding duration and antibiotic types  given that the patient
now has Vancomycin resistant enterococcus 

   Cardiovascular   The patient has a history of coronary
artery disease status post non Q wave myocardial infarction
in   and   bilateral subclavian stenosis  status post
left subclavian stent  ejection fraction of    The
patient was continued on medications of Captopril   mg
p o  t i d  Metoprolol   mg p o  t i d 

Cardiology consult was deferred   Due to the patient s troponin
leak and negative MB fraction and negative MB index  in the
setting of gallstone pancreatitis  there will be no cardiac
intervention at this time  given the  Hospital   medical stability
with no electrocardiogram changes and no chest pain   The patient
will need to pursue an outpatient cardiac work up prior to
cholecystectomy   This has been outlined previously and includes
a stress test to identify any reversible defects  as well as
possible cardiac catheterization to stent fix any culprit
lesions   This outpatient work up can take place anytime within
the next six months but must be done prior to cholecystectomy 

   Endocrine   The patient has no known history of diabetes
mellitus   The patient appeared to have stress hyperglycemia
in the SICU   She was placed on fingersticks q i d  and covered
with regular Insulin sliding scale   After the patient was
transferred back to the floor  the patient had no more elevated
blood glucose  all blood glucoses were less than   before and
after meals   Fingersticks q i d  as well as regular Insulin
sliding scale was discontinued 

   Prophylaxis   The patient was given Protonix   mg p o 
q d  and Heparin   U subcue q  hours for prophylaxis 

   FEN   The patient was given maintenance fluids  and after
her percutaneous drainage  she was made NPO for one day   The
following day she tolerated a clear liquid diet well   The
patient was advanced to full liquids and then to full solids
without event   At the time of discharge  the patient had
tolerated a full solid diet with no nausea  no vomiting  and
no gastric pain   The patient s bowels were moving   The patient
had no urinary difficulty 

   Access   The patient was noted to have very poor peripheral
access   She is not a candidate for internal jugular or
subclavian central lines given the patient s bilateral subclavian
stenoses   The patient therefore had a PICC placed on the left
side   This PICC line will be used for continuation of her
antibiotics 

   Physical therapy   The patient is to have Physical
Therapy evaluation and clearance prior to her discharge

Brief Hospital Course 
A P  Patient is a   y o F with GVHD on immunosuppresion now w 
a productive cough  nausea  emesis and acute renal insufficiency
 
TTP HUS  Ms   Known lastname   was initially admitted to BMT service on
  when she presented with approximately one month history
of nausea  emesis and worsening productive cough  The patient
was recently admitted to  Hospital      through   with diarrhea
and fever  During that admission her diarrhea was felt to be a
flare of chronic GVHD  She was placed on higher doses of
steroids and was started on antibiotics given travel history 
She improved symptomatically and was discharged home  She is
chronically on Rituxan monthly  last dose   and Prograf 
When she was readmitted to BMT   she was initially felt
to have TTP HUS like syndrome and was initiated on
plasmapheresis  She had a total of   plasmapheresis treatments
 last   and improved symptomatically  She was then found
to have disseminated adenovirus infection  isolated from blood
and stool 
 
Transaminitis  Her hospital course was also complicated by MRSA
bacteremia  TEE negative  treated with Vancomycin x   weeks 
and PNA  Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum  treated with Abx  The
patient then was noted to have rising LFTs and direct bilirubin
 total bili peaking at   with   direct fraction  She
eventually underwent US guided diagnostic liver biopy on
  Following her biopsy  the patient was noted to have
decrease in BP  baseline   systolic to   She was
otherwise asymptomatic  Her platelet count at the time of liver
biopsy was   Post procedure  she was not getting
transfused aggressively with platelets due to concern for
TTP HUS and her platelets went down as low as   On the evening
of   she developed abdominal tenderness and urgent CT
scan of abdomen   showed hemoperitoneum  Hct was  
post procedure but she subsequently required   units of pRBCs
  then   unitsp RBCs   then   unit this am  
and most recent Hct is   Surgery was consulted and recommended
conservative management with serial Hct  transfusion support and
close monitoring in the ICU  After her HCT became stable  she
was transferred back to the floor

Chief Complaint 
AF Cerebral bleed on coumadin

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure 
    Mini Maze procedure


History of Present Illness 
The patient is a  year old gentleman with a history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  In the past he was treated with
Coumadin as he had a stroke  However  on Coumadin therapy  he
had an intracranial hemorrhage  The patient was therefore felt
to not be a candidate for ongoing anticoagulation with warfarin
and was referred to me for surgical treatment of his atrial
fibrillation 

Past Medical History 
Cardiac Risk Factors  Dyslipidemia  Hypertension

Other Past History 
 Extra axial hematoma extending from the medulla along the
cervical spinal cord  likely due to bleeding around schwannoma
 
 Left MCA infarct  thought to be cardioembolic secondary to his
atrial fibrillation    He received IA tPA and MERCI
clot retrieval at that time  He had a mixed aphasia with
dysarthria  and right face  arm  and leg hemiplegia and sensory
loss 
 Atrial fibrillation  previously on Warfarin  now off since  
 Hypertension
 Dyslipidemia
 Left cerebellopontine mass  likely Schwannoma
 Pulmonary embolism   
 Papillary renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney  His stroke
occurred in the setting of his anticoagulation being held for a
renal biopsy  This has reportedly been watched closely with no
growth on repeated imaging 
 Sciatica
 Gout

The patient also reports that he was in an automobile accident
on   He was the seat belted driver of a Suburban and
was rear ended  He apparently suffered no known ill effects from
the accident

his midsternal incision   The patient had been admitted on
  for increasing drainage from the sternal wound 
and on   had undergone sternal rewiring   He had
been treated with intravenous and ciprofloxacin and
discharged to complete the course of intravenous antibiotics 
He had remained stable and afebrile postoperatively with a
stable sternum   However  he was seen by his physician on
  who noticed blistering at the inferior aspect
of his wound and started him on Neosporin ointment and
dressing changes t i d    The patient noticed increasing
drainage on   which was purulent then changed to
blood streaked   He had remained afebrile throughout the
entire period   He had also noticed a postoperative cough

clear to auscultation bilaterally   Abdomen was soft 
nontender  and nondistended  with positive bowel sounds 
Extremities had   pitting edema bilaterally  warm  with  
pulses   Saphenous vein graft site was healing well   No
drainage  erythema or induration   His sternum was stable
with wound mostly healed except for purulent to bloody
discharge from the base with a sinus tract superiorly and an
area of erythema of about   cm X   cm

HOSPITAL COURSE    The patient was admitted with a diagnosis
of recurrent sternal wound infection with possible sternal
osteomyelitis   He was started on intravenous vancomycin and
ceftriaxone   Renal and Infectious Disease consultations were
obtained at that time 

He was taken to the operating room on   where he
underwent sternal debridement   The wound was left open  and
on   the patient underwent partial sternotomy 
debridement of skin subcutaneous tissue and bone  removal of
hardware from sternum  omental flap to sternum  and bilateral
musculocutaneous advancement flap  and closure of his open
sternal wound under general anesthesia   He tolerated the
procedure well and was then sent to the Intensive Care Unit
in stable condition 

His initial cultures grew out coagulase negative
Staphylococcus as did cultures from his operating room
specimen   The patient had a temperature spike
postoperatively to    However  subsequent blood and urine
cultures were negative   He was continued on vancomycin and
ceftriaxone postoperatively 

The patient remained intubated after his initial debridement
and was eventually extubated on    He tolerated
extubation well   He was transferred to the regular floor on
postoperative day seven and four and had an unremarkable
postoperative recovery   He remained afebrile  tolerating a
regular diet  and ambulating independently 

He continued to be followed by the Renal Transplant Service 
He was restarted on his CellCept 

From an infectious standpoint  the patient continued to be
afebrile   His ceftriaxone was stopped on day   due to low
suspicion for sternal osteomyelitis   He was continued on the
intravenous vancomycin which he was to continue on for two
weeks postoperatively   Due to the fact that the patient is a
renal transplant recipient he will be dosed by vancomycin and
levels checked randomly every two to three days   The patient
also had bilateral  Location  un   Location  un    drains which had been
draining serosanguineous fluid   He was on levofloxacin which
he was to continue on until the drains are removed 

Postoperatively  the patient also had some swallowing
difficulties and was placed on nectar thick liquids for two
days  however  he recovered normal function and was able to
take a normal diet 

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE   The patient was stable for
discharge  afebrile  tolerating a regular diet  and
ambulating independently

report  she lost her pulse and received   mg atropine    mg
epinephrine  and approximately   minute of CPR  She then
recovered her pulse  She was placed on BiPAP and then intubated
on arrival to  Hospital    She was able to respond to verbal
commands but attempted to remove tube and desatted twice  She
was given   mg Pavulon and placed in wrist restraints  She was
stabilized and transferred to  Hospital    On arrival to our ED  her
vitals were T   HR   BP   RR   O  sat

atheroma in the aortic arch  There are complex  mm  atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta  The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined  The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened deformed  There is critical aortic valve
stenosis  valve area  cm  Mild   aortic regurgitation is
seen  The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened  There
is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral
stenosis  Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen  There is a small
pericardial effusion 

Postbypass
The patient is on an infusion of phenylephrine  There is a
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position which is well seated
with perivalvular leak or significant intravalvular
regurgitation  Gradients are peak mean of   mmHg at a CO of
  L min  Biventricular systolic function is preserved  Mitral
regurgitation continues to be trace  The thoracic aorta is
intact post decannulation 



Brief Hospital Course 
  F with critical AS and hypertension who presents with the
sudden onset of shortness of breath followed by out of hospital
cardiac arrest with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI and
hypoxemic respiratory failure 
  Hypoxemic respiratory failure  Patient presented in
respiratory distress likely in setting of flash pulmonary edema
from critical AS  In addition  patient was persistently febrile
for several days on admission  with sputum culture speciating
with MSSA for which she was treated with   days of vancomycin 
In addition  she received   days of meropenem empirically  The
patient while intubated was diuresed aggressively with a lasix
gtt 
  NSTEMI  Troponin peak   on   and subsequently
downtrended  Given MB elevation  this was felt by Cardiology to
represent ACS with plaque rupture  and the patient was treated
with ASA and heparin gtt   Clopidogrel was not started given
high likelihood for procedure 
  Hypotension  Patient hypotensive in setting of respiratory
failure requiring intubation and critical AS  Levophed weaned
off after intubation 
  Aortic stenosis  Critical as seen on cardiac cath 
  Fever leukocytosis  Patient persistently febrile during
initial admission with leukocytosis  As above  treated with
vancomycin for   days for MSSA pneuomonia  and meroponem
empirically for   days  In addition  poor dentition was felt to
be a potential source  thus dental and OMS consulted  All teeth
were extracted  Patient developed drug rash  likely to either
meropenem vancomycin  Eosinophilia and leukocytosis improved
after stopping antibiotics 
  Possible clavicle fracture  Noted on admission CXR  Will need
dedicated films after stabilization 

On   was brought to the operating room for Aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft surgery   See
operative report for further details  She was transferred to the
intensive care unit for hemodynamic management   In the first
twenty four hours she was weaned from sedation  awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without complications 
She remained in the intensive care unit for respiratory and
renal management   She continued to progress and was ready for
transfer to the floor on post operative day three   Physical
therapy worked with her on strength and mobility   She continued
to progress and was ready for discharge home with services on
post operative day five

History of Present Illness 
 M transferred from  Hospital    Hospital for necrosis of pancreas
seen on CT s p emobolization of pancreaticoduodenal artery  
days ago for upper GI bleed   He was in usual health   days ago
when he had two episodes of bright red blood per rectum with
associated light headedness  no CP or SOB   Was seen in ED
and admitted to medicine service   Tagged RBC showed possible
bleeding proximal transverse colon but EGD   days ago revealed
 welling up  of blood in  nd portion of duodenum with no
identification of source   IR was consulted and embolization of
the duodenal portion of the pancreaticoduodenal artery was
performed the same day    Patient has not had any
subsequent episodes of BRBPR   CT today was significant for
ileus and low attenuation of head of pancreas worrisome for
ischemia necrosis and thickening of wall of duodenum  Patient
was tranferred to  Hospital    for evaluation and care 

During hospitalization patient received a total of   units PRBC
with   of those units being transfused overnight of    He
had an NGT placed prior to transfer to  Hospital     Colonoscopy was

IMPRESSION 
  Large gas  and fluid containing retroperitoneal collection
extending from the region of the second portion of the duodenum
and pancreatic head  along the right flank  through the right
inguinal canal into the right scrotum  The findings are
consistent with duodenal perforation  likely related to reported
recent embolization 
  Necrosis of the pancreatic head  largely replaced by a gas 
and fluid  containing collection  No pancreatic ductal dilation 
   mm cystic lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas 
This could possibly relate to the patient s acute syndrome  as
in the case of focal pancreatic necrosis  versus a primary
cystic lesion of the pancreas or dilation of the uncinate
process duct  If this lesion is not resected  further followup
will be required after the patient s acute process has resolved 
  Massive scrotal edema and right sided hydrocele directly
extending from the retroperitoneal collection  The marked
enhancement about the periphery of the collection and marked
scrotal edema are consistent with inflammatory process

Brief Hospital Course 
This is a   yo M with pancreas necrosis based on CT finding
from  Hospital   
hospital related to embolization of Pancreaticoduodenal artery
on    Since then his GI bleed has stabilized without any
additional events of BRBPR or melena   However a colonoscopy to
evaluate tagged RBC scan findings of proximal transverse colon
was not done   He was transferred to the ICU on   for CHF 
respiratory distress 

CV  Murmur  on cardizem at home  will give IV metop  He had an
episode of A fib on HD   This was a transient episode that
resolved with IV Lopressor 
ON HD   he had an episode of CHF  Respiratory distress and was
transferred to the ICU  His BNP was      Echo  EF   
MR  eccentric  stable c w    On   he another bout of
AFIB   Upon discharge  the patient is in normal sinus rhythm 

GI  GI bleed necrosis pancreas ileus   NGT to suction  NPO 
Protonix  Hospital    serial abdominal exams  T bili was slightly
elevated at   on admission  Amylase and Lipase were also
elevated 

His CAT scan revealed a gross amount of retroperitoneal air and
this tracked down into the right testicular region and was
entirely consistent with pancreatic necrosis gone afoul  The
patient suffered signs of sepsis including atrial fibrillation
and respiratory distress in the day prior to this operation and
he underwent exploration for management 

He went to the OR on   for 
  Exploratory laparotomy 
  Retroperitoneal exploration and drainage of abscess 
  Open cholecystectomy 
  Duodenostomy tube placement 
  G tube placement 
  J tube placement 

He went to the OR on   for 
  Incision  drainage and debridement of right inguinal canal
and the suprapubic space 
  Incision and drainage of scrotum 

He went for EGD on PPD   and this showed a single ulcer large
ulcer was found in the duodenum on the medial wall extending
from the duodenal bulb to the second portion of the duodenum 
The ulcer was partially obscured by debris and necrotic material
but there was a suggestion of ischemia with no obvious mass and
no bleeding 

He was also complaining of right inguinal pain  An US showed no
evidence of pseudoaneurysm  Loops of bowel corresponding to
point of patient s maximal tenderness   He was noted to have
progressive scrotal swelling  A CT the next day showed a right
hydrocele  A repeat CT scan demonstrated evidence of fluid
tracking through the inguinal canal from a retroperitoneal
collection into the scrotum  It was determined that he needed to
go to OR for washout and drainage   The wound was packed with
WTD dressings and we intermittently used a wound vac to help
with healing 

Repeat Abd CT on   showed gastric contrast appears to have
traversed duodenum with a decrease collection w in R abd
wall R scrotum 

Upon discharge  the patient s wound is healing very nicely  and
we are continuing with  Hospital    WTD dressing changes 

H pylori was negative 

Delerium  Possibly related to EtOH withdrawl  He had one
unwitnessed fall when trying to get out of bed  He had family at
the bedside during the day for reorientation and sitter at
night  Geriatrics was consulted for the delirium and
recommendations followed

FEN  A PICC was placed on   and TPN initiated   TPN was
discontinued   and the patient s tube feeds were advanced to
 cc hr   Upon discharge  the patient s tube feeds were Replete
with fiber full strength at a rate of  cc hr with q h  cc
water flushes 

Respiratory  On   He received a tracheosotmy   On   the
trach was downsized   The patient was on and off of the vent and
required a continued stay in the ICU   Upon discharge  the
patient had been off of the vent for   days without signs of
respiratory distress

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS   This is a  year old woman with
a history of left sided chest pressure with radiation to the
back  left arm  and numbness   She received a full cardiac
workup including a transesophageal echocardiogram on
   This echocardiogram revealed a large
 cm X  cm mobile mass in the right atrium   She was noted
to have an ejection fraction of   with normal left
ventricular size and function  and normal mitral valve and
tricuspid valve   The differential for diagnosis for a left
atrial mass included atrial myxoma   The patient was referred
to  Hospital    Cardiothoracic
Surgery for elective removal of the mass 

HO Last Name  STitle    COURSE    The patient was admitted to  Hospital    on   where upon she
went to the operating room and had a thorascopic removal of
the right atrial mass   This operation was performed by
Dr   Last Name  STitle    and Dr   Last Name  Prefixes     The procedure was performed
without incident  and the mass was removed   On opening of
the right atrium it was discovered that the mass was in fact
a Chiari network 

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Recovery Unit   In transport she was on a propofol drip and a
Neo Synephrine drip and was intubated   The patient was
extubated on the first night after surgery 

Her postoperative course was significant for bleeding 
Overnight  it was determined that she was having excessive
blood loss into her thorax   The decision was made to go back
to the operating room to find and control the source of
bleeding 

The patient was brought back to the operating room on
postoperative day one and thorascopic ports were
re introduced   The bleeding was identified and controlled 
The patient was brought once again to the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Recovery Unit and was extubated 

The patient was transferred to the patient care floor on
postoperative day two from the initial procedure and on
postoperative day one from the second procedure 

On postoperative day three from the first procedure  the
patient s chest tube was removed   The patient was able to
ambulate to level IV and had no other complaints   A
follow up chest x ray revealed a small right apical
pneumothorax   The following day a follow up x ray revealed
no increase in the pneumothorax   The pneumothorax was felt
to be stable as the patient had no clinical symptoms  and the
pneumothorax was not worsening 

DISCHARGE STATUS   The patient was discharged to home on
postoperative day four from the original procedure and
postoperative day three from the take back

HISTORY   Baby Girl  Known lastname   is a     week gestational age 
birth weight   grams white female born to a   year old
gravida I  para   by cesarean section due to nonreassuring
fetal heart tracing with decelerations and accelerations and
meconium stained fluid   The Newborn Intensive Care Unit
attended the delivery and the infant emerged with good tone 
spontaneous cry and coated in meconium staining   Heart rate
was good at    No resuscitation or oxygen was needed and
the infant pinked up well on room air   Apgars were   and  
There was good perfusion and the examination was normal 

MATERNAL LABORATORY DATA   O positive  antibody negative 
hepatitis B surface antigen negative  RPR nonreactive 
Rubella immune and GBS positive   Rupture of membranes was  
minutes prior to delivery and the mother did not receive any
intrapartum antibiotics 

Because the mother was GBS positive the infant came to the
Newborn Intensive Care Unit for a sepsis evaluation later on
that afternoon   The infant looked very well and on
examination was completely normal and clinically appeared
well   A CBC and blood culture were drawn and the infant was
returned to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for further care 
However  the CBC came back abnormal with a white count of  
hematocrit of   and the platelets of    A repeat was  
and the blood culture remained negative   Because the infant
had thrombocytopenia the mother s platelets were checked and
they were normal at    The infant continued to look well
without any concerns and so was admitted to the Newborn
Intensive Care Unit   A follow up platelet was the same so
IVIG was started 

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION   The infant s weight was
   Anterior fontanelle was soft and flat   The infant was
found dysmorphic   The palate was intact   The neck and mouth
were normal   There was no nasal flaring   The chest was
clear to auscultation without any distress   The heart was
regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs   Femoral pulses
are normal   The abdomen is soft  nondistended   There is no
organomegaly  no hepatosplenomegaly   Bowel sounds are
active   The anus is patent   The genitourinary examination
is normal female   The neurologic examination is active

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS   RESPIRATORY   The
infant was initially admitted and has no respiratory issues 
Has never required oxygen and has never had apnea 

CARDIOVASCULAR   There are no issues   Pulses have been
normal and the blood pressure has been normal 

FLUIDS  ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION   The infant has been
breast feeding well and P O  feeding well  has received one
bottle and is doing well from that standpoint 

GASTROINTESTINAL   There have been no issues   The infant is
not jaundiced and the bilirubin has been checked 

HEMATOLOGY   The infant initially received IVIG at a dose of
one gram per kilo   Follow up platelet count this morning
   The infant has not had any further petechiae or
anything   To work up the thrombocytopenia the urine CMV was
sent and that is still pending   A maternal PLA  antigen assay
needs to be sent and has not been sent yet   The platelets
should be followed and the infant should be followed for any
further bruising or petechiae   The infant does have a blood
culture pending but the risk of sepsis is low and it does
appear that the infant has sepsis   Antibiotics were not
started due to low suspicion for sepsis and otherwise normal
cbc 

NEUROLOGY   The infant has been totally neurologically normal
with normal examinations and there have been no signs there
have been intracranial hemorrhage   The platelets were always
above   and so no screening examinations have been done 

SENSORY   No audiologic examination has been performed yet 
Examination will be done before discharge 

The infant as transferred to the Newborn Nursery to be with
the parents since breastfeeding is a priority and the mother
will remain in house for several days   The primary
pediatrician is  Hospital   Pediatrics and Dr   First Name   NamePattern     Last Name  NamePattern    CNS 
will assume the baby s care in the newborn nursery   The
infant was breast feeding ad lib   There are no medications
and has received one dose of IVIG and has not received any
immunizations

IDENTIFICATION   Baby Girl  Known lastname   is a   day old full term
infant with presumed neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia who
is being discharged from the regular nursery at the  Hospital

a   gram product of a     week gestation pregnancy to a
  year old gravida I  para   to I mother with estimated date
of confinement of    Maternal history notable for
infertility and depression treated with fluoxetine   There
was no reported history of maternal autoimmune disorder or
bleeding diathesis   Of note  maternal platelets were normal
prior to delivery   Prenatal laboratory studies included
blood type O positive  antibody negative  hepatitis B surface
antigen negative  RPR nonreactive  Rubella immune and group B
strep positive   Pregnancy notable for in  Last Name  un   
fertilization   Delivery was via cesarean section for a
nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing   There was no
intrapartum fever or other clinical concerns for sepsis 
Intrapartum antibacterial prophylaxis was not given   Rupture
of membranes occurred one hour prior to delivery with
meconium stained amniotic fluid noted   The infant emerged
vigorous with Apgar scores of   and  

The infant was initially brought to the Neonatal Intensive
Care Unit for a sepsis evaluation   The infant was well
appearing at the time with no abnormalities noted   CBC and
blood culture were sent  and patient was transferred to regular
nursery  CBC was notable for a white count of   with  
percent polys and   percent bands  hematocrit of   and platelet
count of    Repeat platelet counts confirmed thrombocytopenia
with platelet counts of   and  

At this time the patient was readmitted to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit where physical examination revealed scattered
petechiae but was otherwise within normal limits   The
patient was given   gram per kilogram of IVIG with increase
in platelet count to   and then    This occurred
overnight from   to   and in the morning of  
with the platelet count now in low normal range  the infant was
transferred back to the regular nursery   Urine for CMV
antigen was sent and was negative 

In the well baby nursery the infant has been doing well 
breast feeding and bottle feeding on an ad lib basis with
appropriate intake   The patient has maintained normal urine
and stool output   Weight decreased appropriately from  
at birth to a low of   and had increased to   grams by
the time of discharge 

With regards to the thrombocytopenia  hematology from
 Hospital    was consulted   Overall the course was
thought to be most consistent with neonatal alloimmune
thrombocytopenia   Maternal and paternal samples were sent
for platelet antigen typing   These were sent to the Blood
Center of Southeast  State   phone number of  Telephone Fax    
or  Telephone Fax      The hematologist who is
familiar with this patient is Dr   First Name   NamePattern     Last Name  NamePattern    phone number
 Telephone Fax     or pager through the  Hospital    Cancer Institute
with pager number  Serial Number    Hematology recommended no particular
follow up unless abnormalities were noted on the parental
platelet typing in which case consultation with pediatric
hematology would be useful to allow for proper counseling for
further pregnancies 

DISPOSITION   On   the patient is being discharged on
day of life    Examination is notable for weight of  
Infant is comfortable and well appearing   Skin is warm and
pink without any petechiae or bruising noted   Fontanelles
are soft and flat   Palate is intact   Red reflex is present
bilaterally   Chest is clear without grunting  flaring or
retracting   Cardiac is regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs  Abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly and
with active bowel sounds   Genitalia reveal that of a normal
female   Anus is patent   Femoral pulses are   plus and
symmetric   Hips are stable   Back is normal   Tone and
activity are appropriate   Moro  grasp and suck reflexes are
intact   Infant is minimally jaundiced 

Infant received hepatitis B vaccine on    The infant passed
hearing evaluation bilaterally   Newborn screen was sent per
routine  Routine screening bilirubin was checked and was found to
be   on   at   A M  at approximately   hours of age

thrombosed focal dissection at the superior aspect of the aortic
arch with no involvement of the ascending aorta  The pt was
initially admitted to CT surgery but Dr   Last Name  STitle    evaluated the
pt and determined that since the dissection is type B  does not
go into aorta  management would be medical  and the pt was
called out to the floor on   On the morning of   the
pt was due to be discharged  but was noted to have a new hct
drop  acute renal failure and a rise in CK and troponin 
 
Of note  the pt recently sustained a mechanical vs  syncopal
fall   week ago and does not remember the event  She reportedly

MRA OF THE CHEST    AT  
FINDINGS 
The ascending aorta is normal in caliber measuring   cm in
maximum diameter with no evidence of intramural hematoma or
intimal flap  The transverse dimension of the aortic arch is  
cm  At the distal  superior aspectof the arch beyond the origin
of the left subclavian artery  there is a cap of relatively low
signal material in a lenticular shape on the bright blood
sequences  This cap measures   cm in length and   cm in
thickness  terminating at the beginning of the descending aorta 
On coronal images  there is an irregular interface with the flow
lumen  The findings are consistent
with an isolated dissection that is almost completely
thrombosed  Some axial cine images suggest some trace flow
within  The descending aorta  beyond this finding  shows no
evidence of intimal flap  intramural hematoma or penetrating
atherosclerotic ulcer  and at the level of the pulmonary artery 
the descending aorta measures   cm in maximum diameter  There
are bilateral pleural effusions and no evidence of a pericardial
effusion  The proximal aspect of the abdominal aorta to the
level of the origin of the celiac axis is
normal in caliber without dissection  There are bilateral renal
cysts
incidentally seen 
 
IMPRESSION 
Findings most consistent with isolated almost completely
thrombosed focal dissection to the superior aspect of the aortic

Brief Hospital Course 
The patient was admitted for the aforementioned procedure  for
more details  please see operative note   Patient tolerated
procedure without intra operative complications   Patient was
extubated in the OR and transferred to the PACU in stable
condition  Patient initially recovered in the PACU before being
transferred to  Hospital Ward Name     in stable condition  Prior to transfer 
patient received Magnesium  grams intravenously for a Magnesium
of  
 
The patient initially did well  his diet was slowly advanced and
his pain medication was weaned   The day prior to anticipated
discharge he had an episode of desaturation   ABG  EKG  and labs
were all normal   The episode resolved   The next day we decided
to keep him one more day due to this   Overnight he again
desaturated  developed abdominal pain and spiked a temperature 
A CT scan showed evidence of an anastomotic leak and free fluid
in the abdomen   The patient was taken to the operating room and
explored   It was found that he had an ischemic anastomosis that
had leaked and lead to fecal peritonitis   The anastomosis was
resected back to clear margins which had good blood flow   An
end colostomy was created and the distal colonic segment was
made a Hartmann s pouch   The patient was transferred to the
SICU in fair condition 
 
The patient was extubated shortly thereafter   He was
resuscitated with IVFs agressively as his urine output was low
and his CVP was in the   range   He responded well to this 
His pain was controlled with fentanyl and then switched to PCA
once he was able to use it   Due to the length of time without
nutrition and the anticipated ileus  TPN was started   The
patient remained stable in the ICU and was then transferred to
the floor 
 
His bladder pressures had been running high  and his CVP became
elevated on POD   from his second surgery  We started diuresis
with lasix over the following few days   He diuresed well
without complications   Over the next few days his WBC did trend
up somewhat   Due to his history  we felt it was necessary to
rule out an abscess   A CT scan was obtained which showed no
evidence of abscess or leak   The next day his ostomy began
producing stool   His NGT was removed at this point and he was
started on a clear liquid diet   He tolerated this well   His
foley was removed   His diet was advanced to a regular diet   On
the day of discharge his JP drain was removed as well   He was
doing well and was given appropriate follow up with Dr   First Name  STitle

requiring intubation    The patient usually responds
well to steroids  antibiotics and bronchodilators   At
baseline  the patient is functional and is not oxygen
dependent 

During his   Medical Intensive Care Unit admission 
stress echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization were
performed to rule out ischemia as a cause of low O 
saturations   The stress echocardiogram showed anterior
abnormalities and the cardiac catheterization showed mild to
moderate coronary artery disease with no flow limiting
lesions  normal filling pressures  left ventricular ejection
fraction equal to  

On this admission  the patient states that he had had fevers
the night prior to admission and increased wheezing and
shortness of breath over the past week due to the  hot
weather   On the night prior to admission  the patient
became very short of breath without relief from his albuterol
and Atrovent nebulizers   The patient denies any chest pain 
hemoptysis  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea  orthopnea 
peripheral edema   On the date of admission  the patient was
playing cards with friends  had an episode of nausea and
vomiting which was followed by the patient being found
outside gasping for air and asking for oxygen   EMS arrived
on the scene and his O  saturation was    The patient was
unable to speak  and he was diaphoretic 

In the Emergency Department  his O  saturation was   on
nonrebreather with respiratory rate equal to    Blood
pressure  palp and heart rate equal to    The patient
was then intubated   The patient then proceeded to seize
after receiving lidocaine versed Succinylcholine etomidate
and resolved spontaneously   Patient was given
albuterol Atrovent nebulizers treatment  as well as
Solu Medrol   mg intravenous times one  Fentanyl  and  
cc of normal saline intravenously in the Emergency
Department   His chest x ray showed congestive heart failure 
 His electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block
which was intermittently seen on prior electrocardiograms
during his   admission   His arterial blood gases
was equal to   after intubation   His blood
pressure dropped to  palp and the patient was then begun on
Levophed   mg kg minute and was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit 

Initial laboratories on admission include   White blood cell
count     neutrophils    lymphocytes    monocytes
and   eosinophils   Hematocrit equal to   platelet count

SOCIAL HISTORY   In the chart  it is documented that the
patient smoked tobacco one pack per day times   years 
however  he tells me he only smoked for about   years while
in the service   He denies alcohol use now   There is
documented abuse in the past   The patient is a retired

dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses   Neurological
exam   The patient is moving all extremities spontaneously 

HOSPITAL COURSE   The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit Team to be intubated for his acute
respiratory failure  as well as the hypotension which
initially required pressors   As per the Medical Intensive
Care Unit Teams evaluation  the patient likely experienced
acute respiratory failure in the setting of rate related
diastolic heart failure with likely demand ischemia  possibly
related to increased use of his albuterol   The patient
rapidly responded to positive pressure ventilation and PEEP 
however  remaining tachycardiac while maintaining stable
blood pressure after being weaned from all pressors   He was
extubated on   and did extremely well   He did
require three  one liter boluses for systolic blood pressures
in the  s   He was found to be prerenal as per FeNA
calculation   and the patient received D  normal saline
at   cc an hour for a low urine output on   which
is about   cc per hour throughout the day   The patient s
urine output picked up to   cc per hour with hydration 
Follow up chest x ray on   showed clear lungs  no
effusions and no congestive heart failure   The patient began
to have improved po intake with significantly increased urine
output 

By system 

   Pulmonary   The patient is currently saturating well on
room air at   at rest and   with ambulation   The patient
was begun on a prednisone taper at   mg q d  times three   
mg q d  times three    mg q d  times three and   mg q d 
times three for a total of   days   He received intravenous
steroids while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was
transitioned to prednisone when transferred to the regular
medicine floor   The patient was begun on Singulair   mg po
q d   His MDI regimen was restarted with Serevent   puffs
b i d  Flovent   puffs b i d  Atrovent   puffs q i d  and
albuterol only   puffs q    hours prn   The patient should
not use albuterol nebulizers as he gets anginal symptoms and
tachycardic secondary to those nebulizers and likely becomes
ischemic due to demand 

   Cardiac   The patient s troponin was found on  
to be    This is likely related to his episode of
congestive heart failure   The patient denies any chest pain
at this time   The patient s hypotension improved throughout
his stay with hydration   The patient s lipid profile looks
good  therefore  there is no need to start a statin for his
cholesterol level   The patient continued on his aspirin   It
was decided not to start a beta blocker due to the patient s
significant bronchoreactivity   Possibly consider beginning a
calcium channel blocker as an outpatient  as the patient s
blood pressure tolerates   The patient has never been on a
cardiac regimen at all  so possibly consider Cardiology
Consult as an outpatient 

   Endocrine   The patient was begun on a regular insulin
sliding scale due to the steroid taper   His fingersticks
remained within normal limits   This continued on  
The patient s TSH was found to be low at    Free T  and
T  were sent and are still pending   Albeit  in the setting
of acute illness  the patient will be discharged on slightly
lower dose of Levoxyl then he was getting previously and will
follow up with his primary care physician regarding this
issue   The patient will be discharged on Levoxyl   mcg po
q d  as opposed to his dose he is currently taking which is
  mcg po q d 

   Psychiatric   The patient has a history of depression and
anxiety   The patient had been taking Paxil   mg po q d 
until about a week prior to admission when he ran out of his
prescription   The patient was restarted on Paxil during his
stay 

   Hematology   The patient s hematocrit trended down from
  on admission to   at time of discharge   Rectal exam
showed guaiac negative stools   This is likely dilutional as
the patient was hydrated aggressively due to his hypotension 
This should continue to be followed up by his primary care
provider upon discharge 

   Infectious Disease   The patient was started on
levofloxacin   mg po q d  for a ten day course for
treatment of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation bronchitis   Sputum showed moderate
oropharyngeal flora  likely not a good sample   Blood
cultures have been negative to date 

   Fluid  electrolytes and nutrition   The patient is
currently on a cardiac diet as tolerated and we are
encouraging po intake   The patient is doing well with this
at time of discharge

There are complex  mm  atheroma in the aortic arch  There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta 
There are three aortic valve leaflets  The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened deformed  There is critical aortic valve
stenosis  valve area  cm  Moderate   aortic
regurgitation is seen 
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis  area  cm  Due to
co existing aortic regurgitation  the pressure half time
estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true

neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable  weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support   Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight  She transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery 
Postoperatively Mrs   Known lastname   did develop  rd degree AV block on
the evening of POD   and returned to the CVICU   Nodal agents
were discontinued  and rhythm progressed to junctional vs 
a fib  She remained stable and returned to the telemetry floor 
Chest tubes were discontinued without complication   The patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility

History of Present Illness 
Mr   Known lastname   is a   y o  M with hypertension  prostate cancer
s p XRT   years ago  s p L percutaneous nephrostomy for
hydronephrosis secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis  who
presents with R flank pain  nausea  vomiting  and acute renal
failure 

From       the patient was admitted with hematuria on
the medicine service  He presented passing large clots of blood
in his urine with intermittent hematuria since Novemver  
Hematuria was thought to be due to renal stones  He developed
worsening of his L flank pain and presented to the  Hospital    ED 
During hospitalization  foley placed and CBI started 
Ciprofloxacin was also started for positive UA  Cr was elevated
to   CT showed B L renal enlargement with perinephric
stranding and hydronephrosis without obstructing stone  Cr
trended downward after Foley placed  but then increased likely
due to obstruction  thus L percutaneous nephrostomy tube was
placed on   His hydronephrosis was thought to be
obstructive in nature  likely chronic due to RP fibrosis  For
his pyelonephritis  he was treated with cipro for pan sensitive
e coli x   days  Discharged with urology f u for possible
permanent indwelling NU tubes will be needed 

The patient presented on day of admission due to increasing R
flank pain  nausea vomiting  and weakness  His malaise and
weakness started   days ago  He has been checking for fevers at
home and his highest temperature was   Since yesterday
overnightat   PM  he had chills  nausea  vomiting   times 
with decreased po intake  He noted that his L nephrostomy tube
has had lower UOP  He also found it difficult to start his urine
stream yesterday  Denies dysuria or hematuria  His R sided flank
pain is   and sharp  Using a heating pad and taking a
percocet helped with the pain somewhat  His L sided flank pain
is a   but has been chronic for last   months  These
symptoms are the same as his symptoms when he was previously
hospitalized

IMPRESSION 
  Increased perinephric and periureteral stranding on the right
with mild
hydronephrosis and hydroureter  Stranding likely due to
progression of known retroperitoneal fibrosis but underlying
infection cannot be excluded  No renal or ureteral calculi
identified 

  Status post nephrostomy on the left with decompression and no
residual
hydronephrosis 

  Hiatal hernia and esophageal wall thickening raises concern
for
esophagitis

no evidence of abscess


Brief Hospital Course 
  Hypotension Sepsis due to E Coli bacteremia

Patient had hypotension  bandemia  fever   and urinalysis
suggestive of urinary tract infection  He was admitted to the
MICU and was given fluids but did not require pressors  His
blood and urine cultures grew pansensitive E  coli   He was
treated with ciprofloxacin for a planned   day course 
Surveillance blood cultures remain NGTD  except for one of two
aerobic cultures from   which grew coagulase negative staph
which is felt to have been a contaminant as cultures from  
have been negative and only one of the set of cultures was
positive  He will be discharged with ciprofloxacin   Qday
 dosed for renal insufficiency  to complete a  day course 

  Hydronephrosis

Likely secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis resulting from XRT
for prostate cancer  Per urology instruction  had right sided
nephrostomy tube placed by IR with good result  He had a Foley
which was removed on   He reported seeing scant urine in his
 Depends  daily  On   the left nephrostomy tube was not
producing output and was not able to be flushed by IR  Both the
left and right tubes were replaced by IR on   The right tube
was functioning  but was found to have an extra subcutaneous
loop which may have been causing the patient discomfort  On
discharge both nephrostomies were draining well and the urine
was not bloody 

  Acute renal failure

Secondary to upper GU obstruction  Now with bilateral
percutaneous nephrostomies  Creatinine trended downward during
hopital stay  Medications were renally dosed and nephrotoxins
were avoided  BPH medications were continued 

  Hypertension

Antihypertensives were held for hypotension  On   the
patient s blood pressure was  s s and his amlodipine was
restarted  His benazepril was held until discharge 

  Anemia

Baseline HCT is mid high  s and he came in dehydrated   On
  his hematocrit was   and he was transfused   unit of
packed red blood cells  He was also transfused on   for
graudally falling hematocrit   on   Anemia was felt to
be secondary to chronic kidney disease  There was no evidence of
acute bleeding Iron studies from early  Month  only    were consistent with
anemia of chronic disease 

  Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes   Held oral hypoglycemics
while in house and patient placed on insulin sliding scale  Will
discharge on home medications

Discharge Instructions 
You were admitted to the hospital because you had an infection
in your kidney  The infection had spread to your blood and that
is why you spent several days in the intensive care unit  You
had a tube in your left kidney from your last hospitalization
and one was placed into your right kidney during this
hospitalization  You need the tubes because the urine that is
produced by your kidneys does not flow to your bladder easily 
This probably results from scar tissue from the radiation for
your prostate cancer  but the Urology procedure on  
will investigate this further  During your stay  your left
nephrostomy tube stopped draining  Both the left and the right
tubes were replaced by the interventional radiologists  You also
received two blood transfusions 

The following changes were made to your medications 
START Ciprofloxacin   mg PO Daily

Please continue all other medications  Please be sure to
complete your course of ciprofloxacin 

Please keep your outpatient appointments 

Please return to the hospital if you experience fevers  chills 
uncontrolled pain  dizziness or lightheadedness  shortness of
breath  if you see blood draining from your nephrostomy tubes or
for any other concern

History of Present Illness 
 year old right handed woman presenting with
the above on a background of newly discoverd paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation  She and her daughter were visiting her other
daughter  She was standing  looking out of the window  when she
suddenly said  oh  and the seemed to try sitting down on a
chair 
However  she missed the chair and instead slowly collapsed
between bed and wall  She did not hit her head  Immediately
afterward she was noted to have a dense left hemiparesis and was
unable to speak    was called and she was brought to
 Hospital    There  a CT showed old right temporal
hypodensity suggestive of an old ischemic hemorrhagic infarct of
unknown age  Given this finding tPA was thought to be
contraindicated  Instead  patient was transferred to  Hospital    for
further evaluation and care
